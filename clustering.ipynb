      "-  Development proposals that result in the improvement and expansion of community facilities or the provision of new community facilities will be supported subject to the following criteria being met:   • The proposal will not adversely affect residential amenity or the living conditions of the occupiers of neighbouring properties;  • The proposal will not lead to traffic congestion or adversely affect the free flow of traffic; and  • Access arrangements and off-street parking including cycle parking to promote active travel can be satisfactorily provided.     Proposals to redevelop, extend or replace an existing community facility through enabling development on part or all of the land or buildings occupied by the existing community facility, will be supported where it can be demonstrated through viability evidence that all profits are being reinvested in the development of enhanced or additional community facilities.\n",
      "Proposals which look to improve or replace the community facilities currently provided by CARESCO (or any successor community organisation) will be supported in principle.   37In particular paragraph 6.49 states: “Assessing the level of community support for a local service or facility is a matter of judgement, but could be informed by information such as evidence of the level of recent usage, as well as the number and nature of comments made on an application by members of the local community.\n",
      "For commercially run facilities such as local shops and pubs, the Council considers that a robust marketing exercise is the most transparent way of demonstrating that such facilities are no longer viable.\n",
      "This should be of sufficient duration to allow the local community time to consider making a bid to run or acquire premises of value through the Community Right to Bid.\n",
      "In seeking to justify the loss of local services or community facilities, applicants will also be required to consider whether existing premises or sites can be adapted to retain a viable community facility or service.\n",
      "Effective marketing will in most cases need to be for a continuous period of 12 months at a value reflecting its permitted use with details kept of any offers received and detailed reasoning for declining them.\n",
      "However, in particular circumstances it may be appropriate for alternative arrangements to establish if there is any realistic prospect of maintaining the service or facility.”   Land at Belgrave Square shown on Map 10 in Section 9 is identified for community use (alongside off- street car parking under Policy SNP9).\n",
      "Proposals for a community building will be supported in principle.\n",
      "Proposals to use this land for any alternative use will not be permitted.   Land east of St Andrew’s cemetery, as shown on Map 8 in Section 9, is identified for cemetery use and proposals to create new or enhanced cemetery facilities will be supported.\n",
      "An appropriate risk assessment will need to accompany any planning application.\n",
      "Proposals to use this land for any alternative use will not be supported.   Development proposals that would result in the loss of a community facility, as identified on Maps 12 and 13 in Section 9, will not be supported unless • evidence is provided to demonstrate that the facility is poorly used or not viable in terms of community demand/needs; or • adequate replacement provision is made elsewhere, within or close to the community served. \n",

      "-  (Whaley Bridge Design Codes, AECOM, 2021) Whaley Bridge is well connected with the arterial A6 road to the north.\n",
      "Furness Vale and Whaley Bridge are the gateway to the Peak District National Park from Stockport and Manchester which lie to the north-west.\n",
      "The Neighbourhood Area also includes rail stations at Furness Vale and Whaley Bridge; however, the first mechanised railway began in Whaley Bridge, over the Pennines to Cromford Mills - a World Heritage Site.   There are also connections to the waterways network via the Peak Forest Canal offering a traffic free route through the Neighbourhood Area linking many of the smaller settlements with the historic market town.   There is an extensive area of Green Belt which lies within the Neighbourhood Area – see map on page 12.   Key characteristics of the Neighbourhood Area and our community are illustrated on the following page. \n",
      "-  The Government recognises that reliable broadband internet access is essential for homes throughout the country if they are to benefit from online services.\n",
      "The NPPF states that advanced, high quality and reliable communications infrastructure is essential for economic growth and social well-being.\n",
      "Planning policies should support the expansion of electronic communications networks, including next generation mobile technology (such as 5G) and full fibre broadband connections.\n",
      "Superfast broadband access enables people to work from home and thus reduces the need to travel.\n",
      "Some businesses are run from peoples’ homes and it is an essential requirement for education purposes.\n",
      "Superfast broadband also enables people in the village, especially those who have access limitations, to access services and facilities that would not otherwise be available.   The community consultation revealed that current provision is considered unsatisfactory, given that superfast broadband is essential for keeping pace with ongoing advances in digital technology.\n",
      "This is demonstrated by the substantial number of residents who committed to subscribing to a full-fibre broadband service if/when it becomes available. \n",

      "-  Glossary of terms used and/or relevant to the Walsham le Willows Neighbourhood Plan and supporting submission documents.   Definitions are taken directly from the glossary of the National Planning Policy Framework July 2023, except where stated.   Affordable housing: housing for sale or rent, for those whose needs are not met by the market (including housing that provides a subsidised route to home ownership and/or is for essential local workers); and which complies with one or more of the following definitions:  a) Affordable housing for rent: meets all of the following conditions: (a) the rent is set in accordance with the Government’s rent policy for Social Rent or Affordable Rent, or is at least 20 per cent below local market rents (including service charges where applicable);  (b) the landlord is a registered provider, except where it is included as part of a Build to Rent scheme (in which case the landlord need not be a registered provider); and (c) it includes provisions to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households, or for the subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision.\n",
      "For Build to Rent schemes affordable housing for rent is expected to be the normal form of affordable housing provision (and, in this context, is known as Affordable Private Rent).  b) Starter homes: is as specified in Sections 2 and 3 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 and any secondary legislation made under these sections.\n",
      "The definition of a starter home should reflect the meaning set out in statute and any such secondary legislation at the time of Plan-preparation or decision-making.\n",
      "Where secondary legislation has the effect of limiting a household’s eligibility to purchase a starter home to those with a particular maximum level of household income, those restrictions should be used.  c) Discounted market sales housing is that sold at a discount of at least 20 per cent below local market value.\n",
      "Eligibility is determined with regard to local incomes and local house prices.\n",
      "Provisions should be in place to ensure housing remains at a discount for future eligible households.  d) Other affordable routes to home ownership is housing provided for sale that provides a route to ownership for those who could not achieve home ownership through the market.\n",
      "It includes shared ownership, relevant equity loans, other low-cost homes for sale (at a price equivalent to at least 20 per cent below local market value) and rent to buy (which includes a period of intermediate rent).\n",
      "Where public grant funding is provided, there should be provisions for the homes to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households, or for any receipts to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision or refunded to Government or the relevant authority specified in the funding agreement.       Ancient or veteran tree: A tree which, because of its age, size and condition, is of exceptional biodiversity, cultural or heritage value.\n",
      "All ancient trees are veteran trees.\n",
      "Not all veteran trees are old enough to be ancient but are old relative to other trees of the same species.\n",
      "Very few trees of any species reach the ancient life-stage.   Archaeological interest: There will be archaeological interest in a heritage asset if it holds, or potentially holds, evidence of past human activity worthy of expert investigation at some point.   Build to Rent: Purpose built housing that is typically 100 per cent rented out.\n",
      "It can form part of a wider multi-tenure development comprising either flats or houses but should be on the same site and/or contiguous with the main development.\n",
      "Schemes will usually offer longer tenancy agreements of three years or more and will typically be professionally managed stock in single ownership and management control.   Climate change adaptation: Adjustments made to natural or human systems in response to the actual or anticipated impacts of climate change, to mitigate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities.   Development plan: Is defined in section 38 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, and includes adopted local plans, neighbourhood plans that have been made and published spatial development strategies, together with any regional strategy policies that remain in force.\n",
      "Neighbourhood plans that have been approved at referendum are also part of the development plan, unless the local planning authority decides that the neighbourhood plan should not be made.\n",
      "Heritage asset: A building, monument, site, place, area or landscape identified as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions, because of its heritage interest.\n",
      "It includes designated heritage assets and assets identified by the local planning authority (including local listing).

      "Local planning authorities will be able to trigger a grant of permission in principle for residential development on suitable sites in their registers where they follow the required procedures.   • Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) – a fixed, non-negotiable contribution that must be made   by new development.\n",
      "It is chargeable on each net additional square metre of development built and is set by the District Council.\n",
      "A proportion accrues to the parish council.   • Community Right to Build Order: An Order made by the local planning authority (under the Town   and Country Planning Act 1990) that grants planning permission for a site-specific development proposal or classes of development.   • Conservation (for heritage policy): The process of maintaining and managing change to a heritage \n",

      "-    Term  Definition    Affordable Housing  Affordable housing, as defined by the National Planning Policy Framework, is housing for sale or rent for those whose needs are not met by the market. This category includes housing for sale below normal market prices, part-sale and social or affordable rent.    Allocated Site / Site Allocation  Land identified in a Local Plan or Neighbourhood Plan for particular types of land use, such as housing or employment, to deliver the development strategy and meet its housing requirement.    Ancient Woodland  An area that has been wooded continuously since at least 1600 AD    Biodiversity  The whole variety of life encompassing all genetics, species and ecosystem variations. This includes the plant and animal species that make up our wildlife and the habitats in which they live.    Biodiversity Net Gain  Biodiversity Net Gain is an approach to development that leaves biodiversity in a better state than before, by which developers are encouraged to provide an overall increase in natural habitat and ecological features. Biodiversity Net Gain is part of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The draft Environment Bill (2020) includes a requirement to deliver a mandatory 10 % biodiversity net gain to be maintained for at least 30 years.    Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)  CIL is a charge system introduced in 2010 which can be levied by local authorities on new development in their area. It is intended as the main tool for local authorities to deliver the infrastructure needed (schools, healthcare, transport) to support development in their area. The levy only applies in areas where a local authority has consulted on, and approved, a charging schedule.    Conservation Area  Areas identified by South Cambridgeshire District Council, which have 'special architectural or historic interest', which makes them worth protecting and improving.    Countryside  Common term that indicates the open space outside cities and urban areas, made up of agricultural and natural land as defined by Natural England (ENRR526 Accessible Natural Greenspace).    Development Framework  Statutory designation of the extent of the built-up area of the village – established in the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan (2018)    dph  Dwellings per hectare    Essential Visual Gap  Special designation of the Fulbourn Village Design Guide to broadly identify a tract of land within the Green Belt which is essential to visually separate Fulbourn from Cambridge, even though it contains buildings. The visual gap in this case is established by sensitive low density development hidden among trees.    FPC  Fulbourn Parish Council    Green Belt  A designated tract of land around urban areas where development is restricted and designed to: • Check the unrestricted sprawl of large built up areas. • Prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another. • Assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment. • Preserve the setting and special character of historic towns. • Assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land.    Green Infrastructure Network  A strategic network of greenspace, both new and existing, rural and urban, which supports natural and ecological processes and is integral to the health and quality of life in sustainable communities. It provides habitats for and aids migration of wildlife, flood water storage, urban cooling and local access to shady outdoor space as well as creating attractive spaces for recreation.    Heritage Asset  A building, monument, site, place, area or landscape identified as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions, because of its heritage interest. Heritage asset includes designated heritage assets and assets identified by the local planning authority (including local listing).    Important Countryside Frontage  Designation established in the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan of an edge of the built up area where land with a strong countryside character penetrates into a village or separates parts of it. Designated areas should be kept open and free from development to protect the setting, character and appearance of the village.    Large or Major Development  Development of over 10 dwellings (and which have a combined gross floor space of more than 1,000m2), identified by the South Cambridgeshire Local Plan as sufficiently large to attract additional obligations.    Listed Building  A building of special architectural or historic interest designated nationally by Historic England. Listed Buildings are graded I, II* or II with grade I being the highest. Listing highlights what is significant about a building or site and helps to ensure that any future changes to it do not result in the loss of its significance.    Local Green Space (LGS)  The Local Green Space designation is a way to provide special protection against development for green areas of particular importance to local communities. The land can be inside or outside the built-up area and can be in private ownership, as long as the criteria for designation established by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) are satisfied.    Local Planning Authority (LPA)  The public authority whose duty it is to carry out specific planning functions for a particular area.; South Cambridgeshire District Council in the case of Fulbourn.    Locally Important Views  Views from specific vantage points along roads or public rights of way which are essential to the character and identity of Fulbourn. The Key Views identified in the Fulbourn Village Design Guide (2020) identify many locally important views.    Market Housing  Housing sold or rented at the price determined by the property market at the time of purchase or rent.   \n",

Therefore, though the preparation of the Neighbourhood Plan has been led by Adel Neighbourhood Forum, its con- tent has been primarily informed by the opinions and feed- back received from a series of public consultation events (see the separate Consultation Statement document which is available alongside this Plan).  1.8 In addition to reflecting local opinions and aspirations, neighbourhood plans are also required to be supported by relevant evidence – facts, figures, data, statistics, and research.     Therefore, as part of the plan preparation process, the Neighbourhood Forum have also undertaken an extensive review of existing available evidence, including an analysis of the local population profile and socio-economic statis- tics, a review of planning policy and evidence base docu- ments, including relevant Leeds City Council reports and documentation.   Where gaps in evidence have been identified, the Forum have sought to fill these through undertaking their own re- search or by commissioning bespoke studies by external specialists. \n",
      "-  It is 5 miles north west of the cen- tre of Leeds, 6 miles from Otley, 23 miles from York and 3 miles from Leeds - Bradford International Airport.   Once an isolated and extensive rural parish, Adel is now a distinctive part of the north-western edge of the City of Leeds.   Importantly, despite now forming part of the city’s outer ex- tents, Adel has managed to retain much of its historic iden- tity and traditional village character, the unique qualities of which help to set the locality apart and make it distinct from the wider urban setting.   2.2 Open countryside is never far away in Adel; indeed, much of the Neighbourhood Area is formed of open fields or swathes of woodland.\n",
      "Green Belt countryside lies to the north and east, whilst the wooded valley of Adel Beck forms the eastern and southern boundary of Adel.   Access to these various green and natural landscapes is facilitated by a generous network of footpaths and bridle- ways, which link through to the wider countryside and to a number of strategic public rights of way, including the Dales & Ebor Way footpaths, Leeds Country Way and the Meanwood Valley Trail.\n",
      "The Yorkshire Dales National Park is also within easy reach.  2.3 Adel is nearly 500 feet (150 m) above sea level.\n",
      "It displays a gently undulating topography at its northern end.\n",
      "The historic core and most of the area’s residential land sits upon a plateau, from which the land-form dips away at the north and eastern boundaries associated with the wooded valley corridor.     This sloping topography combines with the wider green setting to create numerous attractive long views out from Adel towards the surrounding countryside and wooded landscape.  2.4 The Adel Neighbourhood Design Statement (Adel NDS) was prepared in 2006 to give ‘Design and Planning Guidance for residents and developers’.\n",

      "Birkolme (essentially a hamlet) also lies along the A151, some 1.5 miles to the west of Corby Glen.   Corby Glen is located between Bourne (8 miles to the south), Grantham (12 miles to the north) and Stamford (15 miles to the south east).   Much of the village lies on the eastern slope of a valley formed by the West Glen river, now much less substantial than in former times.\n",
      "This river occasionally floods fields and roads in the perimeter of the village.   The surrounding countryside is undulating, with a mixture of woods and farmland.\n",
      "It overlays Jurassic limestone, which has provided a ready source of building stone, as evident in the older parts of the village.   The farmland around Corby Glen is mainly arable, comprising large open fields.\n",
      "In contrast to former times, it is mainly worked by large enterprises, including the private estates of Irnham, Grimsthorpe and Easton.\n",
      "Owing to increased mechanisation, the number of residents involved in agriculture has declined substantially over the last 50 years.   Because of the relative size of Corby Glen, the facilities available in the village are used by surrounding communities from the villages of Swinstead, Swayfield, Irnham and Burton Coggles. \n",
      "-  Archaeological finds indicate that there has been some occupation in the vicinity of Corby Glen since prehistoric times.\n",
      "The Romans also inhabited this area, and Roman pottery fragments have been found in the village.   The village probably did not become a significant settlement until the Danish invasions in the 8th- 9th centuries.\n",
      "The name Corby means “woody place” in Danish.\n",
      "The original name was changed Corby Glen in 1953 to avoid confusion with the town of Corby in Northamptonshire.   By the 11the century Corby was a significant village and was mentioned in the Doomsday book; at this time much of its land was controlled by the Bishop of Lincoln.\n",
      "The presence of a manor house in what is now Birkholme was also recorded, but this no longer exists and the present-day Birkholme Manor dates from the 19th century.   Throughout most of the medieval period (i.e., up to late 15th century), Corby was a thriving village and administrative centre, including for imposition of the law.\n",
      "The annual Corby Sheep Fair was established in 1238 and remained an important event in the farming calendar right up until the 1970’s. Although its significance for the sale of livestock has declined, the Fair remains an important part of the identity of the village.   The development of Corby from the 11th to 15th century was accompanied by the establishment and progressive enlargement of St John’s church, which would have been at the centre of everyday life through the medieval period.   By the end of the 15th century, most of the land in and around Corby Glen was either in the hands of religious institutions or owned by aristocratic families.   Towards the end of the medieval period, Corby was declining as an administrative centre, as adjacent towns and villages became more important.\n",
      "The religious upheavals of the 16th century brought great changes to Corby, including the closure of local religious institutions and re- distribution of their land to the aristocracy.\n",
      "By the end of the 16th century most of Corby was part of a large estate owned by Sir Richard Thimbleby, Baron of Irnham.   In the late 1700’s financial problems caused the then owners of the Irnham estate to sell or lease plots of land in Corby.\n",
      "This attracted newcomers to the village, and it became a more open and diverse society, with many independent farms and businesses being established.   The opening of a railway station at Corby Glen in 1852 brought a further phase of prosperity, but by the end of the 19th century the general drift towards urban living meant that the village was in decline.   The first and second world wars caused another phase of social upheaval; horizons were broadened, and social structures and values changed, such that the role of the village community in everyday life was diminished.\n",
      "This trend continued and accelerated through the 50’s and 60’s, and by the 70’s the village population had fallen to around 500 and there were relatively few local businesses.\n",
      "The railway station closed in 1959. \n",

      "This correlates with data on the nomisweb website that reports an average of 7 rooms and 3.4 bedrooms per household.\n",
      "Given that the average household size is 2.4 (see nomisweb website), it could be argued that there is an over-provision of larger properties in relation to a potential demand from older people for smaller houses and bungalows.  2.5 Community facilities and activities in Corby Glen     In common with most villages, there have been significant changes in available facilities over the last 50 years.\n",
      "The range of shops has decreased, various village sporting clubs (tennis, cricket, football) are no longer functioning, and allotments are no longer available.\n",
      "The Methodist and Catholic churches have closed and the number of public houses has reduced considerably.   On the other hand, new things have come into the village: the Charles Read Academy, the new Market Cross and Glenside Surgeries, the nursery at the Ron Dawson Hall, the Willoughby Gallery, The March Hare Tea Rooms and Lily’s Lavender Hut.   The following facilities are currently available in the village:     Bowls club  Fighting Cocks pub  Nisa grocery store    Charles Read Academy  Fire station  Post Office (mobile service)    Church Street Rooms  Glenside surgery  Ron Dawson Hall    Pre-school nursery  Lily’s Lavender Hut  St Johns Church    Primary School  March Hare  Swinstead Road garage    Primary School Childcare  Market Cross surgery  Willoughby Gallery    Dance Academy*  Mobile Post Office  Woodhouse Arms pub     Based in the old Methodist Chapel. \n",
      "Studio is available for hire when free.   Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Corby Glen had a range of clubs which included a Bowls Club, Brownies, History Society, Horticultural Society, Line Dancing, Scouts, Womans’ Institute, Yoga and Youthclub.\n",
      "Unfortunately, a number of these have still to be re-established following the end of the Covid restrictions.\n",

      "Part of The Green extends across Station Road and contains the childrens’ play park.\n",
      "Originally, the Green was used for sheep pens during the Sheep Fair.\n",
      "A funfair is still held on the Green.\n",
      "but now the sheep sale is held in a nearby field belonging to the Easton Estate.\n",
      "The Green extends to another open space alongside Tanners Lane, bordering the West Glen River.\n",
      "The Green provides an attractive view for those passing through the village on the A151.   A further open space is St John’s churchyard, which surrounds the church and is bordered by the old vicarage and open fields.\n",
      "The Motte, a designated ancient monument, lies to the north-east of the Market Place, west of St John’s church.\n",
      "It is a large medieval mound, possibly marking the location of an early defended manor house, and is surrounded by the remains of a moat, but no trace of any building remains.\n",
      "The site is largely overgrown.  2.4 Population and housing     Unfortunately, Parish level information from the 2021 Census was not been available at the time of preparing this document.\n",
      "However, some tentative data is available at:   https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/eastmidlands/lincolnshire/E34001500 corby_glen/   The population estimate was 1060 (2020 estimate); it was 1017 in 2011, and 719 in 2001.\n",

      "The population density was 2,304/km² (based on 2020 estimate).\n",
      "The annual population change (2011 to 2020) of 0.45% was limited, and this highlights the great challenges which will arise from the need to accommodate almost 300 new houses and 600 to 1000 residents.

      "-  Origins and history  3.1 Walsham le Willows is a thriving, rural village lying on the edge of the central boulder clay area of Suffolk in the Ancient Plateau Clayland area known as High Suffolk with gravels and loams to the south and west and heavier land to the east.\n",
      "The parish is located within Mid Suffolk District and lies approximately 10 miles (16 km), northeast of Bury St Edmunds, 9 miles (14.5 km) southwest of Diss and 11 miles (17 km) west of Stowmarket.\n",
      "The main village settlement is supplemented by four outlying hamlets, West Street to the west, Four Ashes to the immediate south, Crownland lying southeast and Cranmer Green to the east.\n",
      "Between The Street and Four Ashes lies an area of parkland surrounding a Georgian mansion known collectively as The Grove.  3.2 The village is surrounded by farmland which gently slopes down towards the stream in the valley bottom which divides the parish longitudinally.\n",
      "The surrounding landscape is interspersed with woodland, copses and mature hedgerows.\n",
      "These form wooded horizons and combine with the wide-open views, to provide a strong and rural sense of place.\n",
      "The historic settlement is predominantly along the underlying gravel terrace of the stream.\n",
      "This runs along a shallow valley draining the surrounding fields and broadening as it travels west towards Badwell Ash where it forms a water meadow.  3.3 Evidence of human activity in Walsham le Willows dates back to Neolithic times.\n",
      "The earliest archaeological indication of permanent settlement here was during the Romano-British period.\n",
      "The place name ‘Walsham’ is Saxon in origin and the village appears as Wal(e)sam in the Domesday survey.\n",
      "Surviving manorial court documents reveal that by the beginning of the 14th century, a sophisticated system of local administration and justice was already operating within a populous and prosperous community.2  3.4 Elizabethan Walsham le Willows is also extremely well chronicled, largely thanks to Nicholas Bacon, Queen Elizabeth I’s Chancellor.\n",
      "He was gifted the Manor of Walsham in 1559 and kept copious notes.\n",
      "He also ordered a written survey of his holdings the archive of which can be found in The Field     2 Ray Lock, The Court Rolls of Walsham le Willows 1303-50 and The Court Rolls of Walsham le Willows 1351- 99 are published by The Suffolk Records Society in two volumes.   Book Of Walsham le Willows 1577.\n",
      "The remarkable survival of the village’s 14th century Manorial Court Rolls, additionally provide eloquent and important detail for historians seeking to understand how rural life was changed by The Black Death of 1349.\n",
      "Walsham le Willows was recorded as having between 1250 and 1500 inhabitants at the beginning of the year, nearly half of whom perished when plague struck that spring.\n",
      "This death toll had far-reaching effects on the local economy and society.\n",
      "The story of how the residents of Walsham le Willows responded during this period was portrayed in the BBC documentary ‘Lucy Worsley Investigates: The Black Death’ (BBC2, 24th May 2022).3 3.5 Another notable local resident was landowner and Puritan Ralph Margery who in 1643, as England descended into civil war, raised his own cavalry of 112 men, later known as the ‘Thirteenth Troop of Ironsides’ to fight for Parliament in the New Model Army.\n",
      "With reference to Margery, Cromwell wrote: “I had rather have a plain russet coated captain that knows what he fights for, and loves what he knows, than that what which you call a gentleman and is nothing else”.\n",
      "Walsham le Willows is privileged to have had a comprehensive archaeological field survey of the entire parish carried out during the early 1980s by village volunteers under the guidance of Suffolk County Archaeologist Dr Stanley West which contributes to the wealth of documentary evidence charting the parish’s evolution and development.4 3.6 The historic core of Walsham le Willows runs east west alongside a tributary to the Little Ouse, known locally as The Stream.\n",
      "The majority of the parishes 60 listed buildings, many of them built during the 16th century are found here.\n",
      "A large number of the pre-20th century houses lining The Street reveal, by way of their large rectangular or bay windows, rear wooden workshops, backyards and side tracks, their former incarnations as shops, weaving rooms, bakeries, shoe repairers, butchers, wheelwrights, blacksmiths, ironmongers, watchmakers, schools and the Reading Room.\n",
      "The presence of so many trading establishments is evidence that Walsham le Willows comprised a relatively complex, flourishing and self-sufficient community until at least the early 20th century.

      "They were businessmen, intellectuals, and philanthropists.\n",
      "They saw how badly housed their farm workers were.\n",
      "The Martineaus began a programme of creating new homes for their employees.\n",
      "Designed as terraces of 2, 3 or 4 dwellings, these intricately detailed brick and oak buildings were constructed in a distinctive Arts and Crafts or mock Jacobean style with short non-biblical inscriptions carved into their beams, bressumers and bargeboards.\n",
      "These buildings, along with the Priory Rooms, the former Reading Room and the Lych Gate to the cemetery, are now much treasured icons of the village.\n",
      "Each property offered accommodation for a family, with outhouses for washing, latrines and bakehouses and a quarter of an acre of land so that families could grow their own food and keep chickens.\n",
      "A pigsty was sited at the end of each garden, wells to provide water for each little community and in some places a widow’s room, the 19th century version of a granny annex where the widows of deceased farm workers could live out their days safely, within their community.   3.8 Council house building began in the 1920s.\n",
      "On Grove Road, the Parish Council instigated new building in order to rehouse local people from elsewhere in the village.\n",
      "In 1930, the Parish Council proposed the demolition of 6 existing village properties to be replaced by a total of 12 new houses on the Wattisfield Road.\n",
      "A further 16 houses were built along Palmer Street in 1937 and in the 1960s more single storey dwellings for the disabled and elderly were provided in Grove Park and Miller’s Close.\n",
      "Thus resulting in an extensive provision of council houses in Walsham le Willows.\n",
      "Two small late 20th century developments at Broad Meadow and Jolly’s Way were built on land sold by local farmers at a discount with the proviso that priority should be given to first time buyers with connections to the village.   3.9 The Church of England Temperance Society founded its branch in Walsham le Willows in the 1860s and villagers were encouraged to sign the ‘pledge book’ and thus refrain from drinking.\n",
      "The Society was successful in reducing opening hours and introducing punishments for transgressors but during the time of its existence there were still five pubs in the village.\n",
      "Nonconformist worship has also held a significant presence here.\n",
      "A Baptist Chapel, now disappeared, was established at Cranmer Green in 1818.\n",
      "Palmer Street hosted the iron chapel of the Plymouth Brethren from the late C19th until 1996 by which time the number of its worshippers had dwindled and the site was sold to make way for a private home.\n",
      "On The Street, opposite the bend, where the stream flows under the bridge, and away from view, stands the grand flatly pedimented classical red and white brick façade of the early Victorian Congregational chapel.\n",
      "The chapel hosts regular services and for the past fifty years has been the venue for an Easter Convention with preachers and worshippers attending from across the country.\n",

Walsham le Willows today   3.10 The most recent population figures are from 2019, when Mid Suffolk estimated the parish population was approximately 1,213 residents living in 512 households.   3.11 Two local trusts, The Old Town Trust and the Town Farm Charity have remits to provide help for those in need within the community.\n",
      "The Old Town Trust holds land for locals to farm.\n",
      "It owns the 16th century weatherboarded Guildhall on The Street which provides accommodation for local people and the rents raised from the farmland are donated to charitable purposes within the village.\n",
      "The Town Farm Charity gives grants from the proceeds of the sale of former common land at the far east of the parish.\n",
      "Its object ‘for the general benefit of the inhabitants…which provision cannot be made out of rates, taxes or public funds’. \n",
