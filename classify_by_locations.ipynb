The Neighbourhood Plan has been prepared such that Clifford parish stakeholders (residents, businesses, landowners and other organisations) can have a real influence over what development takes place in the parish and ensuring that its rural and historic character are protected - while at the same time ensuring that it remains a vibrant and sustainable settlement.\\nThe development of the Neighbourhood Plan is based on extensive research and is influenced by extensive engagement with these stakeholders.\\nThe policies and proposals set out the clear wishes of the stakeholders in the parish.

A particular feature of this landscape is the former railway line running from Penda’s Field and bounding the western fringe of Scholes village before heading out of the Parish towards Thorner.\\nThe dismantled railway provides a strong green corridor with a particular opportunity to be developed as an off-road cycle path in the future.   Whilst the landscape here is less interspersed with historical features than the east, the open space at Scholes Lodge Farm is the site of a former manor house and gardens and Limekiln Hill between Scholes and Barwick-in-Elmet clearly too reflects former industrial activity.   Of particular note in landscape terms and one which connects to the two principal settlements of the Parish is Rakehill Road, which crosses the countryside west to east in the form of a ‘green lane’.

The Leeds Core Strategy recognises the importance of the surrounding green space (and inherent links – including some of those identified by the community), identifies much of it as ‘The Limestone Ridge’ and designates it as ‘Strategic Green Infrastructure’ (see The Neighbourhood Plan Map).\\nThis designation is based on a 2009 study by Natural England which looked at green infrastructure corridors for Yorkshire and the Humber.\\nSpatial Policy 13 states that these corridors will be maintained and enhanced.\\nThis Neighbourhood Plan cannot strengthen the protection afforded by this policy.   Within and adjacent to Aberford village, linear features such as the ‘Drovers’ Verges’ constitute additional local green links which perform important functions as environmental buffers, wildlife corridors and recreational access routes, connecting the community with the surrounding green space.\\nThese are detailed at Appendix 1.   Opportunities for enhancement also exist.\\nThese links are deserving of protection in their own right and as such, this plan designates them as ‘Local Green Infrastructure’ feeding into the ‘Strategic Green Infrastructure’ and affords them protection via the following policy.

In July 2011, the Leeds Open Space, Sport and Recreation Assessment rated Aberford Playing Fields and Tennis Courts and St Ricarius Churchyard (Cattle Lane) as ‘poor’, with Aberford Church of England Primary School (playing fields), Aberford Allotments (Field Lane) and St Ricarius Church (School Lane) only ‘fair’.\\nIn the years following, Aberford Playing Fields and Tennis Courts and Aberford Allotments have both been subject to improvement and are now considered by the parish council to be in ‘good’ condition.\\nBased on a 2016 community assessment of sites, the condition of sites overall is considered to have improved.\\nThe assessment is detailed in the plan’s online evidence base.   Leeds Core Strategy Policy G4 (New Green Space Provision) states that in areas of adequate green space supply such as Aberford (ref the Leeds July 2011 assessment), contributions of an equivalent value towards the safeguarding and improvement of existing green space will take priority over the creation of new areas.\\nIn this circumstance, qualitative improvements would be needed to address the pressures placed upon existing green space in the form of increased usage and increased demand arising from new residential development.   Neighbourhood Plan Policy GE4 adds local flavour to Policy G4 through the identification of specific sites in need of enhancement, based on the 2016 assessment’s identification of ‘poor’ and ‘fair’ sites.   In 2015, the community overwhelmingly endorsed a policy intention which included the provision of ‘new, meaningful green space’ linked to new developments.\\nThe green space needs of Leeds District have been identified in the aforementioned Leeds 2011 assessment.\\nThis showed that Aberford is adequately catered for in all categories of green space and recreation (relative to applicable standards) with the exception of indoor sports facilities.\\nGiven Aberford’s current size and population, it is clearly unreasonable to expect the provision of such a facility within the village.\\nCore Strategy Policy G4 states that new on-site provision of green space at a standard of 80 square metres per residential unit will be sought on development sites of 10 or more dwellings on sites outside the city centre and in excess of 720 metres from a community park.\\nThis policy is likely to cover Aberford’s future needs and there is no evidenced reason to vary from the standards which would be applied.\\nAs such it is considered that there is no need for a separate Neighbourhood Plan policy on this subject.

While no housing needs assessment has been carried out for Aberford, assessments have been completed for the comparable nearby parishes of Barwick and Scholes (a direct neighbour to the west) and Clifford, both within the Outer North East Housing Characteristic Area.\\nKey conclusions of each in respect of the characteristics of housing needed may also reasonably be drawn for Aberford:-  • Younger households seeking to upgrade, with smaller households likely to need and/or afford smaller dwellings;  • An aging population living in larger homes seeking to downsize, coupled with increasing numbers of older people suggesting housing for independent living for older people likely to be in demand;  • Likely lesser demand for the very largest properties (4+ bedrooms);  • Higher demand for homes up to and including 3 bedrooms;  • A need for policies that address imbalances in the local household and dwelling profile and predicted demographic change.     Core Strategy policy on housing mix (Policy H4) states that development should include an appropriate mix of dwelling types and sizes to address needs measured over the long term, taking into account the character of the location.\\nIt further states that for developments over 250 units, in or adjoining the Main Urban Area and Major Settlements and for developments over 50 units in or adjoining ‘Smaller Settlements’, developers are required to submit a Housing Needs Assessment (HNA) addressing all tenures so that the needs of the locality can be taken into account at the time of development.\\nIt is assumed that this would cover any major housing development that may or may not be allocated in the Neighbourhood Area.   On smaller sites, however, there is no such HNA requirement and therefore no guarantee that locally evidenced needs would be met.\\nPlan policy will address this situation.   Core Strategy Policy H8 addresses ‘Housing for Independent Living’ and states that developments of over 50 dwellings are expected to make a contribution to supporting needs for independent living, with very large developments having the potential to provide sheltered schemes and smaller developments contributing in other ways, such as bungalows or level access flats.\\nPolicy goes on to set more detailed locational requirements such as walking distances to town or local centres or access to community facilities.\\nThis policy should ensure that any housing development over the stated threshold will provide for elderly people’s needs and that new development would be appropriately provided for in relation to facilities.   The above does not however cover the needs of elderly people wishing to downsize in order to remain within Aberford village.\\nNeighbourhood Plan policy will address this by reducing the dwelling threshold trigger.

The A58 runs through the heart of the village, connecting Leeds with Wetherby.\\nWhilst the A58 provides excellent road access to major cities, it does have the negative impact of dissecting the village.\\nThe village also lacks a main focus point due to the above-noted absence of community services.   At a village meeting in early 2012, local residents completed a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) that identified the need and desire to create a greater village focus.\\nThis was reiterated in the Village Questionnaire that was circulated to residents in July 2012, where the need for a shop was also strongly articulated.\\nRespondents to the Village Questionnaire, some 123 people, identified that access to quality countryside and the footpath networks of the village is widely valued by the community.\\nThere was a strong demand for improved formal recreation and leisure space, from children’s play space to a park and allotments, as being beneficial to the fabric of the village.\\nThere is a strong sentiment from the survey that residents would prefer no new housing development in Scarcroft, although it was recognized that this ideal position is unlikely.

In mid-2016, Leeds City Council’s proposals to pursue major new housing development in the area, in the form of a Parlington New Sustainable Settlement, prompted the updating of this vision, to take account of this significant possible change in local circumstances.\\nA resultant new vision, with a set of aims designed to achieve the vision, were consulted on in the Pre-Submission Draft Plan, receiving some 79% support from respondents.   In the light of the parish council’s decision to now pursue a plan not specifically addressing a potential Parlington development, the following revised vision is set out, together with a set of aims designed to achieve the vision and to guide the development of neighbourhood plan policies to deliver those aims.

There are two dedicated histories of Alwoodley, both written by residents of the parish in the early twenty-first century.\\nThey are An Illustrated History of Alwoodley (Leeds, 2005) by Stephen Burt and Alwoodley, Leeds: The History of a Twentieth Century Suburb (Leeds, 2004) by Graham Branston.\\nStephen Burt also produced Old Alwoodley in Photographs (Leeds 2004).\\nWhat follows here is an edited version of a history based on these three sources and written by David Ellis.\\nA full, comprehensively referenced version of the history is available on the Alwoodley Parish Council website.   The name Alwoodley is possibly of Saxon origin, meaning either “clearing in the alder wood” or “Athelward’s forest glade or clearing”.\\nAlwoodley is referred to in the Domesday Book (1086) which reveals that the area was farmed in the late eleventh century by someone named Rosketill.\\nIn 1200 Adel Mill was the subject of a bitter legal dispute between the Abbot of Kirkstall and the Prior of Holy Trinity Priory, York.   From the Middle Ages until the end of the nineteenth century Alwoodley was ‘essentially a collection of dispersed farms with early enclosures, heath, marsh and woodland’ (Branston, 2004).\\nAlwoodley was occupied by smallholders, eking out a meagre living in difficult conditions.\\nThe residents of the area farmed sheep and grew crops in sheltered places.   In the late medieval period, Alwoodley Old Hall was constructed and it was the seat of the Frank family until 1638 when it was sold to the Clifton family.\\nThe Hall was included in the land leased to Sandmoor Golf Club and it was demolished in 1969 due it its dilapidated state.\\nAlwoodley was largely untouched by the industrial revolution, though on its borders Scotland Mill on Adel Beck was the place where flax was first spun with water powered machinery by John Marshall in the late eighteenth century.   In the 1840s, land acquired from the Earl of Harewood by the Leeds Waterworks Company was used to build Eccup Reservoir to provide the City of Leeds with clean drinking water.\\nThe reservoir was expanded in 1850 and again in the 1890s, bringing it to its present size.\\nThe reservoir became part of a system of reservoirs serving Leeds, most of which are located in the Washburn Valley.\\nFour shafts, excluding the valve chamber, were constructed in Alwoodley to serve the tunnel from Eccup Reservoir to Seven Arches aqueduct.   6\\n|\\nP\\na g e   From the late nineteenth century, Alwoodley provided a rural retreat for residents of the expanding industrial city.\\nAdel Crags and the Seven Arches Aqueduct were popular attractions in the area.\\nVerity’s Tea Rooms in Adel Woods and Carrie’s Café on The Avenue provided refreshments to these tourists from the city.\\nIn the 1930s, several people built their own holiday homes in Alwoodley.\\nThe constructions were considered insanitary by the City Council and most were removed after the Second World War.   Until the 1920s, Alwoodley was part of the Wharfedale Rural District Council under the West Riding of Yorkshire County Council.\\nUnder an Act of Parliament in 1927, Alwoodley was incorporated into Leeds.\\nThe residents of Alwoodley, represented by Alwoodley Parish Council, had originally been opposed to incorporation into the expanding city.\\nHowever, they were persuaded to agree to incorporation when the City of Leeds offered Alwoodley ratepayers a preferential rate for 15 years.\\nIncorporation provided Alwoodley with modern utilities and services, such as water, gas, electricity, street lighting, sewerage and improved roads.

It is important to say that a Neighbourhood Development Plan is not a mechanism to resist or stop development: it is a Plan for shaping development.\\nWithout one, a community would have less control over what happens in the period covered by the Plan.\\nBut the Plan must be in ‘general conformity’ with the Local Plan as developed by Leeds City Council, as well as with national government policy as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework and Guidance.

An alternative point of view is from historian Hazel Hill (nee Green), who was brought up in Scarcroft and undertook a field study of the site as part of a research project.\\nSubsequent to the work she published a paper of her findings and in which further study is recommended.\\nBelow is an extract from her paper which makes interesting reading.   “The majority of the material of which the earthworks are constructed is of the reddish Permian basal sands.\\nThis reddish material can be observed in the lower levels of construction.\\nOn the summit of the western bank are cart load-sized mounds of a whiter limey material.\\nThis, I suggest, was a later addition of waste from the upper (eastern) Magnesium Limestone quarries.\\nGround level access for tipping was only from the north east corner.\\nHere on the bridleway, traces of old tracks from the quarries converge.\\nTipping was on two arcs leaving an oval “arena” within.\\nA central mound - at least at the southern end - was constructed as part of the original design.\\nA low level entrance was built at the south west corner.\\nThe question is why, if this was just waste disposal; why wasn’t the area just completely filled in and levelled?\\nI feel there must be some purpose for this design.   Pyramid tipping is clearly visible throughout the site.\\nEach sloping layer of about one metre depth is overlain by another layer, but kept well back from the edge of the lower layer.\\nThis prevents slumping.\\nThe best view of this pyramid tipping can be seen from the top of the western arc at the southern end, looking down on to the entrance.   Since the original tipping - as shown by areas where pyramid tipping is visible - later additions have been made, material has been relocated, the central mound extended northwards and, most recently, (within the past hundred years), some material has been removed from the site.\\nWorked flints of possibly Mesolithic and Neolithic type have been found in the Milner beck area, near Jubilee Bridge.\\nDrawings of some of these were seen at the West Yorkshire Archive Service in Wakefield (WYAS).   A Roman altar has also been found near Milner Beck.\\nHazel Hill in researching the site did not find any flints there, but she did find two worked flints, close to the Roman road/bridleway, just east of Milner Lane.\\nOne is a small button scraper about a centimetre across, showing the curved marks of the bulb of percussion where it was struck, and it has been finely pressure worked on each side.\\nThe other is a triangular, broken, but skilfully worked flint, which was possibly an arrow head.\\nThey may be of Bronze Age origin.   Other items found on a field walk, in the plough soil, close to the bridleway, just NE of Milner Lane were a lump of iron slag, a piece of dark green glass cullet, part of an oyster shell, fossilised wood, a section of clay pipe, a lump of coarse red brick with inclusions and a piece of light coloured mediaeval pot.\\nThe first three items could have been of Roman origin, but the last three are of later date.

Provide a footpath from Wood Lane junction with Thorp Arch Park to the start of the unmetalled track leading from Wood lane to Flint Mill Grange.\\nThe proposal is for a separate path to be created on the field side of the easterly hedge of Wood Lane.\\nThe path would be 1.8m wide, surfaced with a suitable material for pedestrians and be separated from the fields by a stock-proof post and rail fence.   This section of Wood Lane is a main route from Thorp Arch Village to Wetherby Road and thence to Wetherby.\\nIt is not marked out as a double lane road and requires vehicles to move close to the verges to pass each other.\\nIt has no footpath and has uneven grassy banks which make it difficult for walkers to seek refuge from passing traffic.\\nThe route is also marked as a way to Thorp Arch village from the traffic free cycle route 665 at Walton Gates.   The project was part of the consultation proposals put to all residents and this particular proposal was overwhelmingly supported by those who responded.

It is important to note that local needs have been identified through the consultation process, which focus on wanting to protect family homes from demolition to have flats built in their place and to protect bungalows from conversion to two storey homes.\\nThe continuing need for single storey accommodation in particular for older residents and the loss of these to create larger residences should be resisted if possible.   60 |\\nP\\na g e \"), ('22d36d74-fbec-42ba-9d41-d5b9e7a7c434', 'Alwoodley', '17', 'Views', ' From King Lane there are views to the north of Adel Woods.

At the outset of the process, the qualifying body, in our case Bardsey cum Rigton Parish Council, was required to define the area that the Plan will apply to and have that approved by Leeds City Council.\\nFor parished areas such as ours it is normal for the established Parish boundary to be the limits of this ‘Neighbourhood Area’, although that is not always the case.\\nThe Parish Council applied to the City Council for the whole of our Parish to be defined thus on 14th April 2012 and this decision was endorsed by Leeds City Council on 25th September 2012.\\nSince that time, however, there has been a small but significant alteration in our Parish boundary with neighbouring Scarcroft and both Parish Councils requested that their Neighbourhood Area boundaries be brought into line with this change.\\nThe current Neighbourhood Area and Parish boundaries are illustrated in Map 1 overleaf.   There is considerable flexibility as to what is included in a NP.\\nThe principal objective is to define policies for the use and development of land, and to address the social, environmental and economic consequences of such development.\\nIdeally the NP becomes a broader statement of the vision which a local community has for its own future.   It is equally important to understand what a NP is not.\\nIt cannot be used to impede proposed developments which have already gained planning consent.\\nIt should also fit into the Local Authority’s core strategy for development, not conflict with it.   The Neighbourhood Plan cannot be couched in terms designed to stop all development (indeed it should be in favour of appropriate development), but it can and should define the nature and extent of development ac- ceptable to, and required by, the local community.   Preparation of a Neighbourhood Plan requires adherence to certain procedures and basic conditions, including extensive public consultation.\\nBefore it can be made, the Neighbourhood Plan and its supporting material must meet the legislative requirements and pass examination by an Independent Examiner.\\nMost importantly of all, it must then have been put before the community in a local referendum, and gain a share of the vote in excess of 50% of those who cast their vote.   Once made the Neighbourhood Plan gains legal status as part of the Leeds Local Development Plan and the Local Authority is under a statutory responsibility to afford full material weight to the Policies of the made Neighbourhood Plan when considering planning applications.   Bardsey Parish Council take the view that although the Neighbourhood Plan is intended to represent a longer term view of the development of the Village, circumstances may change.\\nIt has therefore decided to conduct a regular assessment of the Plan, and of progress towards the achievement of its objectives and projects, every 5 years.

Firstly it must achieve a democratic mandate to be adopted at all, established by a majority of residents voting in favour of it in a village referendum.\\nSecondly, once adopted (and unlike earlier documents) it has statutory authority.\\nIt becomes part of the framework of legal regulation shaping many aspects of the development of Bardsey-cum-Rigton, and cannot be simply ignored or circumvented.\\nThese essential differences afford the community greatly increased input to key aspects such as housing development.   The Government’s intention is that the Neighbourhood Plan should be a key factor in Bardsey’s development for the next 15 years.\\nAs you will see it therefore includes policies covering a wide range of issues from healthy lifestyles to preserving the essential character of both the built and natural environments.\\nBecause of its relative importance and complexity, much of the work which has gone into its production has related to housing development, however.   Although at the time of submission Leeds City Council’s Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) is fortunately not seeking large scale housing development in Bardsey, our own Housing Needs Survey (HNS) identifies a clear need for some new housing in the Parish.\\nThe Neighbourhood Plan therefore includes strong planning policies designed to facilitate these smaller developments in appropriate locations, subject to the high design and quality standards desired by us all.   Finally I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to all our residents on behalf of Bardsey cum Rigton Parish Council, the Neighbourhood Plan Steering Committee and myself for your unfailing support and enormous contribution during the extended period over which our Neighbourhood Plan has been in preparation.\\nWe quite literally could not have delivered it without you.\\nThe reward is a Neighbourhood Plan which sets the course for our community for years to come, and will ensure the vitality and essential character of our very special Village is preserved for future generations.

The decision to draw up such a Plan is optional, but not to do so would forego this unique opportunity for set- ting out our proposals for the growth of our community for the next 15 years.   Bardsey cum Rigton Parish Council therefore took the decision early in 2012 to draw up this Neighbourhood Plan.\\nThis document is a result of the efforts of a number of individuals and a series of consultations with resi- dents and other stakeholders.\\nThe NP sets out our strategy for seeing our community continue to flourish in the years ahead.

But the Neighbourhood Plan does not stop there.\\nHousing development is a key issue, but other equally im- portant aspects of Bardsey’s future are also included: for example a long term aspiration for Bardsey School, for health provision, for sport and leisure facilities, and for the natural environment – including our footpaths, bridleways, cycle ways, nature reserves, and green spaces.   The outcome of the City Council’s Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA)1 process has not removed the potential for ad hoc planning applications by developers.\\nWithout a NP in place the Village remains vulnerable to inappropriate development.\\nWith a NP in place, the wishes of the community will become part of the very process of planning in Bardsey cum Rigton.   1 SHLAA is a process undertaken by LCC to identify potential development sites by working with landowners and others who would like to propose land as available for housing development.\\nInclusion of a site in the SHLAA does not prejudice any future decision making with regard to a site being granted or refused planning permission.

The majority of the houses in the Parish are owner-occupied, and the rented sector is small.\\nProperty values reflect the village's desirable location for the executive market.\\nHomelessness is not an immediate local problem, but premium property prices cause many young people to leave the village to find affordable housing.\\nUnemployment All Hallows Church Hetchell Court is below the national and district averages, and most people work outside the Parish.\\nHowever, there are a number of small businesses located within the Parish, for example building contractors, landscape gardeners, decorators and providers of financial services.\\nThe pub, hairdressers and three caravan parks also provide some jobs.\\nAgriculture remains an important part of the Parish economy, but changing practices have resulted in much reduced levels of employment.\\nAn increasing number of residents are known to work mainly from home, taking advantage of modern technology.   The Anglican church of All Hallows, with its Saxon tower, is one of the oldest in the north of England and has a thriving congregation.\\nBardsey Primary School sits on two sites and is a ‘good’ school (OFSTED, February 2013) with 178 children on the school roll (2015).\\nIt serves the nearby village of East Keswick, as well as several other surrounding villages.\\nThe school has joined the Wharfe Valley Learning Partnership and is now a Trust School.\\nThis means that the school now holds its own Title Documents and the land belongs to the school within the Trust.\\nThe vision (aspiration) that the School Governors have held for many years is to rebuild a single site school which conforms to contemporary standards of access and amenity.\\nSecondary education is not available in the Parish but is well provided for in the nearby towns of Wetherby and Boston Spa, as well as North Leeds.   The community is sufficiently large and varied to support many thriving voluntary groups together with a range of social, leisure and educational activities.\\nThese are mostly centred on the Village Hall and the Callister Hall located in the historic core of the village, adjacent to the tennis courts and crown bowling green.   The Sports Club, on Keswick Lane, adds to the range of facilities available to include well supported cricket and football teams.\\nNext to the Sports Club is a well equipped children’s playground, and Park Field which is an ‘unstructured’ park area used by children and dog walkers.

About our Parish > Wetherby. Administratively, it is in the ward of Harewood. It is primarily', ' residential, with a population of approximately 2500 and almost 1,000 homes.   The Village originated as a small farming community and is listed in the Doomsday Book of 1086 as belonging to William, King of England.\\nThe oldest buildings, including All Hallows’ Church, parts of which are of Saxon origin, and the Bingley Arms Public House dating from 953AD, are situated in the historic core of the village, designated as a Conservation Area.   The village developed with the creation of a road between Leeds and Wetherby in the early I820’s, later to become a turnpike and then a free highway, the forerunner of the A58.\\nFollowing the arrival of the railway in   A58 North, from Mill Lane   1877, and later the growth in car ownership, people chose to live in rural surroundings and commute to Leeds, and the Village grew dramatically from the 1920’s onwards.\\nClosed in 1964, much of the railway route remains undeveloped and may yet become part of the national cycle network.\\nToday the busy A58, which runs through the Parish from north to south, and the A1M motorway, which passes 3 miles to the east, provide excellent road links north and south.   Bardsey is located on the bus routes from Leeds to Wetherby, providing access to public transport.\\nOne of these routes is a direct service along the A58, and the other routes via Bardsey Village (Keswick Lane), East Keswick and Collingham.\\nImproving the frequency and accessibility of public transport links, thereby reducing dependency on cars, remains an aspiration.   There has been a primary school in the Village since 1726, originally located in the building which now serves the community as Callister Hall.\\nIt was replaced by a modern school in 1951 and is located on Woodacre Lane.   Unlike many villages, Bardsey is not one single tightly located community, but a series of loosely linked and geo- graphically separate settlements, each being of different character.\\nThis has some attractions, but it also provides a number of challenges which were recognized in the Village Design Statement of 2002 and the Parish Plan of 2003.

Development proposals must be underpinned by a robust analysis of both the village of Walton of the immediate site context to inform the scale, massing, form, materials and details of any proposal  2. Development proposals should consider the importance of St Peters church to the village, including opportunities to protect and enhance its setting and impact on the local skyline  3. Small grass verges and landscaping to the edges of the highway are a particular feature throughout Walton and these features should be incorporated wherever possible  4. Wherever possible, the orientation of buildings should front the main highway, as characterised throughout Walton  5. Variation of the building line to the street will assist in mirroring the character of Walton where existing dwellings have a range of setbacks, from buildings which meet ‘back of footpath’ through to dwellings with generous front gardens with mature landscaping  6. Vertical articulation of dwellings and their façades should be dealt with sensitively.\\nMany dwellings in the village benefit from chimneys which add definition to roof lines and also pitched canopies to entrance ways offer articulation to the front façade, joining the ground and first stories;  7. Landscape treatments within front gardens are a strong visual feature of streets within Walton, and a landscape plan for a development of any size should be considered from the outset, with plants, shrubs and trees provided with space to mature within the built form layout;     This document has been produced by Walton Parish Council on behalf of the community, with the help of the Leeds City Council Neighbourhood Planning Team.\\nIt has been supported by grant funding from Locality.

It is certain that the character of Barwick in Elmet and Scholes is strongly shaped by its history and heritage and that this is highly valued by residents and visitors alike.\\nA living example of how the community cherishes its heritage is the celebrations which take place around the Maypole in Barwick in Elmet which draws visitors from far and wide.   Both Scholes and Barwick in Elmet have historic cores to the villages designated as Conservation Areas containing perhaps the best of the parish’s built heritage.\\nHowever, the parish is blessed with a rich built heritage across the whole of the area, including isolated farm and estate houses on the Parlington and Bramham estates.\\nThe latter estates provide strong reminders of past wealth.   In planning for any new development, the particular features of village character areas and the countryside beyond need to be taken into account, for example in the use of building materials and in the design of the existing building stock, particularly that which forms the historical core of the settlements.\\nThis applies equally to new build as to renovations, conversions and any alterations covered by permitted development.   In Barwick in Elmet and Potterton, the dominant building materials are magnesian limestone with blue (welsh) slate roofing: for Scholes, red brick is more reflective of the heritage of the place but limestone is also evident, again with blue slate the dominant roofing material.\\nOf course, variations to this vernacular exist with red pantile roofing in particular appearing outside Conservation Areas.   The Conservation Areas in both main villages are very well maintained and provide strong indicators for how future development should take place, with many distinctive features detailed in the Conservation Area Appraisals and Management Plans and reflected on further in the draft Village Design Statement.\\nPotterton, although too small for a Conservation Area itself, is well maintained and is distinct in the Neighbourhood Area, although not in the City, as a ‘dark’ village that is without street lighting.   Consultations revealed strong support for limiting urban sprawl into the surrounding open countryside, maintaining the open nature of the Neighbourhood Area.\\nIn addition, consultation for the first draft of this NP revealed strong support for this policy with 93% of respondents supporting proposals to maintain and improve the quality of the built environment through design policy 47Barwick in Elmet and Scholes Neighbourhood Plan 2016 '), ('0694a3a3-a9c3-4fbe-9798-1142b3b1625c', 'Barwick in Elmet & Scholes', '76', '5.2 Landscape and the Environment (LE) > 5.

In Autumn 2012 we issued information and a questionnaire on Leeds City Council’s (LCC) proposed Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) sites asking for comments.\\nThen in 2013 LCC added a further, very large, proposed site on Green Belt land at Headley Hall to the SHLAA.\\nThe NPSG issued a further questionnaire and held drop in sessions in the village hall to again give information to residents and gather views.\\nThe majority of responses indicated firm opposition to the proposed large site and work within the NPSG therefore became focused on opposing it rather than developing the Neighbourhood Plan.\\nThen, in Autumn 2015, University of Leeds, owners of the land at Headley, withdrew the site and the NPSG resumed work on the Neighbourhood Plan, using all of the views and information gathered to inform the Neighbourhood Plan questionnaire, which was issued in September 2016, and the Plan itself.   In addition to the engagement outlined above with the initial Community Conference, and questionnaires and drop in sessions on the SHLAA sites, we have throughout kept residents involved and informed through the monthly Parish magazine, and through our Neighbourhood Plan and Parish Council websites.\\nAt conferences and drop in sessions, members of the group have been there to engage personally with residents.\\nWe have also stressed throughout that new members are welcome and needed, and are pleased to have had new members joining.   On the wider spectrum of engagement, we encouraged residents to engage with Leeds City Council by advising them how take part in the SHLAA consultation and encouraging them to do so.\\nWe kept them advised of progress and developments within LCC as well as within our own group.   At every stage of consultation residents’ responses were retained and analysed, providing the basis for our vision and for the Neighbourhood Plan questionnaire, which was issued by volunteers to each of the 760 approx.\\nhouseholds in Bramham, during the summer of 2016.\\nCompleted questionnaires could be returned by Freepost, and also by handing in at our Village Shop, a focal point in Bramham.\\nWe were delighted that over 40% of households returned their completed questionnaires.\\nA summary of the responses is shown in the Consultation Statement Community Survey 2016.   A consultation event was held to discuss the draft vision, themes, objectives and policies in the Village Hall on 4th February 2017.\\n32 people attended the event which resulted in a number of useful discussions and comments.\\nThese comments were analysed by the steering group and were incorporated into the Plan where appropriate.   A business survey was conducted and a questionnaire was delivered to businesses within the parish in June 2017.\\n47 questionnaires were posted to local businesses whilst another 36 were made available at Bowcliffe Hall.\\nThe responses were analysed and are the results are shown in the Consultation Statement Bramham NDP Business Survey 2017.   In August 2017, the NPSG opened a conversation with University of Leeds with the aim of consulting on its future plans for the land that it owns in the south of the parish, that is currently used for agricultural research and education.   This continued engagement and ensuing responses have ensured that our Neighbourhood Plan has been developed using the views of local residents and local businesses at every step.\\nThis, and our use of Bramham’s well used community facilities and hubs, such as the Parish magazine, websites, the Village Hall and the Village Shop have resulted in a Neighbourhood Plan that is a true community product.

The area has always been agricultural, however throughout its history the Parish has been quarried for its limestone which was used in the construction of Roman York and has continued to be exploited ever since.\\nMore recently, the village’s position on the Great North Road (A1) has shaped its development.\\nBy the seventeenth century Bramham had established itself as an important staging post for travellers and had many coaching inns.\\nThe village was at its peak in the nineteenth century when further development may have been constrained by the presence of major landowners in the area such as Bramham Park which is now home amongst other things to internationally famous events such as the Bramham Horse Trials and the Leeds Festival.   In the first half of the 20th century Bramham also played its part in the two World Wars.\\nDuring the First World War an airfield opened at Headley at which a squadron of the RFC/RAF was based.\\nDuring the Second World War dummy aircraft were placed on the airfield to mislead the enemy into thinking that the base was still active.\\nThere can still be found one of the aircraft hangars now a listed building.\\nAlso during the Second World War Bramham Park was home to a Prisoner of War camp for Italian prisoners.\\nThe War Memorial in the village square bears witness to the human cost to the parish.   The Great North Road continued to pass through the village until 1960 when the first bypass was built.\\nThis had the effect of giving the village back some of its rural character.\\nHowever, the lack of passing trade meant the decline of local shops.   Today, Bramham is a modern village within the metropolitan district of Leeds and has a very active and lively community.\\nThis is well demonstrated by the existence of a wide range of committees, clubs and groups, organising events and activities for people of all ages, as well as maintaining important facilities and services that benefit residents.   The village retains very close ties with the Lane Fox family (descendants of Robert Benson, first Lord Bingley), owners of the nearby Bramham Park estate.\\nBramham Park is not only home to a fine, Baroque country house and splendid gardens, both open to the public during the summer months, but also known for hosting an international four day equestrian event (Bramham Horse Trials), and more recently as the site of the Leeds Festival.\\nCurrently, residents of Bramham are given free tickets for the latter in return for making a small financial contribution to the Bramham Community Fund.   Leeds City Council’s adopted Core Strategy identified Bramham as a smaller settlement.\\nSmaller settlements are defined as communities which have a population of at least 1500, a primary school, and a shop or pub.   According to the 2011 Census, the parish of Bramham had a population of 1650, of which 99% were from a white ethnic group.\\nOf the 718 households, 534 households had access to one or two cars or vans and 86 households had access to at least three cars or vans.\\n98 households did not have access to a car or van.\\nThe Census showed that 18% of the population were between the ages of 0-17, 6% were between the ages of 18-24, 10% between the ages of 25-34, 16% between the ages of 35-44, 25% between the ages of 45-59, 14% between the ages of 60-69 and 11% were 70 and over.

These were firstly an ecclesiastical system of parishes, usually coincident with one or more townships, with a church at the parish centre and secondly a manorial organisation which was not always so directly related to the township framework.\\nThe parish structure was largely in place in the Leeds area by the 11th century and remained relatively unchanged until the urban growth of the industrial period.   The ownership of land and the attendant manorial framework, however, were subject to continual change.\\nThis changing pattern of ownership and tenurial organisation through the Middle Ages and later, led amongst other things, to the unusually large number of 17th-18th century park estates, which still survive in the belt from Harewood in the north, through Bramham and Parlington, round to the south-east side of the District at Ledston and Temple Newsam.\\nToday, features such as manor houses, moated buildings, gardens, castles, mills, fishponds and deer parks still survive from this time.\\nLocal buildings in Bramham were historically built with Magnesian Limestone, although more recently, brick and other materials are used.   In 2010 study by Natural England3 looked at green infrastructure corridors for Yorkshire and the Humber.\\nIt determined that much of the area surrounding Bramham village, (although not the village itself), including Bramham Park, was designated by S19 Limestone Ridge (see map 4: Green Infrastructure Corridor Map4 ). The Limestone Ridge is a subregional corridor which runs from the south of Doncaster to Wetherby.\\nMost of the corridor is rural and it is characterised by large blocks of woodland and rolling farmland bounded by hedges and distinctive limestone buildings.\\nThere are also a number of parkland estates including Bramham and, as such, the area has both landscape and historical importance.   Bramham is located within the Magnesian Limestone Belt and is further characterised by gently rolling fields of arable which are bordered by low gappy hedgerows and isolated hedgerow trees, with small pockets of intact pasture occurring around the village fringes.\\nIt is surrounded by open arable farmland which typically occurs in the lower lying and gently rolling eastern pans of the district, including east Bramham.\\nThe openness of the farmland and lack of woodland allows for long uninterrupted views.   Bramham Moor was unenclosed until the nineteenth century but is now enclosed and cultivated, forming a productive area of large regular fields, interrupted by occasional woodland and patches of pasture.   Map 4: Green infrastructure corridors (Natural England)   The main watercourses that run directly through Bramham are Carr Beck and Bramham Beck.\\nThe Environment Agency’s flood maps (map 5 and map 6) indicate that there is a low risk of flooding from rivers and seas and a medium risk of flooding from surface water.   3http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140605112209/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/regions/yorkshire_and_ the_humber/ourwork/yandhgreeninfrastructuremappingproject.aspx '), ('d86b7d7e-7a35-48f1-8376-f9a470c21622', 'Barwick in Elmet & Scholes', '34', 'Barwick in Elmet with Scholes Parish > Housing Evidence Base May 2015 > Contents > The characteristics of parish, its households and housing', ' 2.

The evidence suggests that the parish has many features that distinguish it from the city, the region and England.\\nCompared to these larger geographies the key differences are:  • over the decade between the 2001 and 2011 censuses the parish population has declined even though the number of households increased, due to decreasing average household size;  • there are fewer young children and young adults;  • there are considerably more people over the age of 65;  • people that are economically active are more likely to be in higher and medium level occupations; and people are healthier and are less likely to have limitations in their day to day activities even though there is a high proportion of older residents in the parish.     4. There are significant trends within in the population:  • a declining number of young people resident in the parish; and  • a growing number of older people resident in the parish.     5. The housing stock:  • has a very high proportion of detached houses and bungalows with a very low proportion of terraced homes, flats and apartments;  • has a high proportion (over 75%) of homes that have 3 bedrooms or more;  • generates a low supply of re-sales and re-lets as households tend to stay resident in the parish long term;  • generates high demand, driven by easy access to labour markets by road, a high quality environment and good schools.\\nThe parish is described by stakeholders as ‘a place to move up to’.  • is consequently more expensive than average prices for Leeds and the region  • is unlikely to be affordable to households on average income unless they can find significant deposits; and  • is unlikely to be affordable to first time buyers.     6. There is little supply of social or affordable housing in the parish.\\nAlthough many households on the waiting list for social housing aspire to live in the parish, limited supply from relets means that there is only a small amount of active demand.

The key finding of our review are that:  • the parish local housing market sits within the outer north east quadrant of the City of Leeds;  • the population of Leeds grew by about 5% in the decade 2001-2011; due mainly to an excess of births over deaths in the city however there is a net outflow of people from Leeds to other local authority areas;  • the number of households is rising at a slightly faster rate than the population due to the diminishing average size of households across the city.\\nThis is smaller than the rate of change for England;  • new housebuilding completions are running at over 2,000 homes per annum across the City and this number of completion is expected to rise;  • the volume of sales of re-sale and new build housing dropped dramatically after 2008 and is only recently showing signs of recovery.\\nLand registry data quoted in Chapter 2 suggests that the parish was less affected by this;  • average house prices in Leeds are higher than across the region but below the average for England;   '), ('06c688c6-06e2-44f3-b08c-4159cb58363a', 'Barwick in Elmet & Scholes', '182', 'Chapter 5: The household survey > Part B of the survey: households thinking of moving home within the next 5 years', ' 5.14 Part B of the survey form gathered information from households who intended to move home over the next 5 years.\\n41 households said that they were seeking to move home at some point over the next 5 years.\\n40 households were existing households and one was a new household seeking to live independently.\\nReaders should note that totals in the following tables sum to 40 or 41 households depending upon whether the information is regarding supply or demand.\\nWe asked households a series of questions about their current housing and household.\\nBelow we have summarised key outputs from the survey.

Memorial board    Percy Cross    In February, in heavy snow, Percy’s army marched towards York. Sir Thomas Rokeby, High Sheriff of Yorkshire, heard of Percy’s approach and raised his own army, and blocked the bridge at Knaresborough. Percy’s army advanced through Boroughbridge and Wetherby, and was being pursued by the King’s men, so he went on to Tadcaster, until he stopped and positioned his men on Bramham Moor to await the arrival of Rokeby and his men. The battle started at 2pm, and although it was short, it was said to be furious and bloody. It is generally believed that Rokeby led the charge against Percy and began a violent spree of hand-to-hand combat. Percy’s army was rapidly defeated with Lord Bardolph being fatally wounded and Percy himself lost his life, either by being killed in action or captured and then quickly executed.    The spot where Percy fell was subsequently marked by a memorial stone cross, which was removed to a wood on the edge of the battlefield as it interfered with the farmers’ cultivation of the land.    Moves are afoot to move the cross into the village  where it will better protected and appreciated by  villagers and visitors to the battlefield.    5http://historicbramham.org.uk/battle-of-bramham-moor3.html    Our survey showed that 82% (245 people) wanted the battle of Bramham Moor site and memorial stone to be protected. This Plan therefore identifies the Bramham Moor Battlefield, as specified on map 8, as a valued landscape area. This identification is the equivalent of that covered by the previous policy    H1 for non-designated local heritage assets and has been informed by the same criteria published by Historic England in their Local Heritage Listing Advice Note 7 (May 2016). However, there are key differences in the nature of the site compared to other proposed local heritage assets, and the Steering Group decided to create a separate policy for the Battlefield, recognising:    The extensive nature of the battlefield. The lack of certainty of its precise boundaries i.e. where the battle started or finished.     The essential nature of the land which is almost entirely agricultural with few physical features that distinguish it as an heritage asset from other parts of the adjoining countryside.   In summary, the area covered is recognised for the importance of the historic events that took place there, not for any remaining physical features.   In that non-designated heritage assets are identified by the local planning authority, the Parish Council will nominate the Battlefield and provide the supporting evidence to the City Council for inclusion in the Schedule of non-designated heritage assets maintained by the Council as part of the AMR.   Policy H2 provides protection for the integrity and historic interpretation of the Battlefield as a valued landscape area.   33BRAMHAM NEIGHBOURHOOD DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2018-2033 '), ('227712e0-c3af-42be-86ac-f68194903f81', 'Clifford', '54', 'Clifford parish – a brief sketch > the parish of Clifford today', ' 59% of chief income earners are in employment – mainly in Leeds or York – with 41% of household main earners in retirement.   93% of households are satisfied with living in the parish of Clifford.

To support the continuing use of the University of Leeds Estate for agricultural/research/ academic purposes and other developments which comply with Policy UoL.1  There are three main areas of built development at the site as illustrated in the site plan (Map 16: University of Leeds site map): • Wise Warren Farm - the farm comprises an occupied house and a series of outbuildings that are predominantly unused (see map 16).        Bramham has a unique character that must be preserved and enhanced wherever possible. This does not mean that new ideas and materials should be dismissed but these need to be considered alongside high levels of design to ensure that the unique character of Bramham is never lost. Any alterations, extensions or additions to the built environment need to be carefully considered in order for them to help maintain and enhance the overall appeal of the parish.   b) Reflect local building design, form and style.\\nc) Where possible, reflect the best design within those parts of the Conservation Area, adjacent to the proposed development.\\nd) Take full account of heritage buildings and other assets.\\ne) Encourage innovative building design where appropriate.   c) Where possible, reflect the best design within those parts of the Conservation Area, adjacent to the proposed development. d) Take full account of heritage buildings and other assets. e) Encourage innovative building design where appropriate.    Outside the Conservation Area, there are the areas of housing on the north side of the village together with small pockets of housing elsewhere. The original council estate is a great asset to the village with solidly built houses. Their unique character with spacious gardens especially onto Clifford Road need to be retained. Similarly, the newer estates within the parish have a character of their own. Although they are not unique in their design and similar examples can be found throughout the country they add to diversity of the area.   f) To be supported development proposals must demonstrate they will not result in additional on-street parking of vehicles.   f) To be supported development proposals must demonstrate they will not result in additional on-street parking of vehicles.    The principles of design and detailing of all structures within the Conservation Area should be extended to the remainder of the parish in order that the unique nature of the village is never lost nor dwarfed by buildings of a different nature surrounding the conservation area. In particular, the small hamlet around Headley Hall is quite unique and care should be taken to ensure that it does not lose its appeal owing to its existing character. The parish is a small community in rural surroundings but the existing small spaces within the actual village are vital to the overall appearance and character that we aim to retain and enhance. The spaces are of equal importance to the actual buildings and it is not only the actual spaces enclosed by the buildings but the views that are to be seen between these structures. Over recent years, many spaces have been lost, gardens have been built on and many views blocked. This has had a detrimental effect on the appearance of the village and care must be taken to ensure that the overall character is not destroyed. It is essential that spaces between buildings are given a high priority when consideration is given to any planning application for extensions and in fills. It is not merely the buildings that make the village unique it is the roads, footpaths, courts and spaces between structures that add to the character and well-being of the parish.    The design and detailing of all external spaces are as important as the design of actual buildings that surround them, (including car parking spaces). The character of the area can be greatly enhanced by the detailing of street furniture and materials. The street scene is very important. Care needs to be taken to retain areas of paving and setts and not replacing them with tarmac. The existing stone walls around the parish need to be protected and kept in good order as they add to the character of the parish. Of specific importance are the walls bounding Aberford Road, Windmill Hill and Bowcliffe Road.

These views should be protected.    2. From village square, south towards Almshouse Hill    aim to protect view of traditional village buildings dating from the village’s early history and the war memorial.    The CAAMP notes the importance of key views as follows: “Despite the gradient of Town Hill, Bramham village effectively nestles in a distinct hollow and is therefore not highly visible within the wider landscape, though good views into the village are possible from the outer edges of the settlement. From within the village itself Town Hill and Almshouse Hill offer commanding views of the houses around the historic core, and views out of the village toward the surrounding agricultural and park land are always important.”    3. From the Jubilee Gardens, south towards village centre – aim to protect view of traditional dwellings leading to village square.    4. From cattle ramp towards the Red Lion public house – aim to protect view of historic cattle ramp, Carr Beck, public house, and square.    5. From village square towards Senior Citizens’ Centre and garden – aim to protect view of traditional building and green space in the heart of the village facing the square.    6. From Lyndon Road incorporating green space and then north towards Clifford – aim to protect view of green space on Lyndon Road and rural aspect to north of village.    In addition, the Core Strategy Policy P10: Design, states that development will protect and enhance locally important buildings, spaces, skylines and views. There are eight key short range views and nine key long range views in to and out of Bramham. These are illustrated in map 13 and map 14 and noted as follows: 7. From the junction of Aberford Road and Freely Lane looking north up Freely Lane – aim to protect view of Historic building (Bramham Lodge) and playing field opposite.    8.

From New Road, east towards All Saints’ Church – aim to protect view of historic church and churchyard.    Long range views:    1. From Aberford Road south east down Headley Lane – aim to protect view of open countryside and agricultural land in south of Bramham parish. 5. South along Windmill Road, looking uphill towards the Windmill – aim to protect open countryside with view of the historic windmill.    6. Oglethorpe Hills towards Oglethorpe Hall Farm – aim to protect open countryside on eastern edge of village giving view of historic farmhouse.    2.

The site was originally predominantly used for teaching and research on arable, dairy and pig production.    In the 1990s, the University leased much of the land to a wholly owned subsidiary company called the University of Leeds Farms Ltd. However, since this point the use of the farms for teaching has broadly declined. Many of the current buildings within the site are vacant and in need of repair, e.g. Wise Warren Farm.    13% (39 respondents) answered, I am against all forms of development associated with renewable energy within Bramham Parish.    49% (145 respondents) answered, yes, providing it is small scale and out of sight.    The University are currently in the process of dissolving the University of Leeds Farms Ltd and developing a new estate strategy. The intention is to dissolve the limited company with a view to managing the estate within the Facilities Directorate under a new structure. The research activities will bring some buildings on the three existing farms back into use where possible. However, it is likely that some vacant buildings will need to be converted to other viable uses (eg residential). There is the potential to convert the existing agricultural barns at Wise Warren Farm to dwellings.

In Autumn 2012 we issued information and a questionnaire on Leeds City Council’s (LCC) proposed Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) sites asking for comments.\\nThen in 2013 LCC added a further, very large, proposed site on Green Belt land at Headley Hall to the SHLAA.\\nThe NPSG issued a further questionnaire and held drop in sessions in the village hall to again give information to residents and gather views.\\nThe majority of responses indicated firm opposition to the proposed large site and work within the NPSG therefore became focused on opposing it rather than developing the Neighbourhood Plan.\\nThen, in Autumn 2015, University of Leeds, owners of the land at Headley, withdrew the site and the NPSG resumed work on the Neighbourhood Plan, using all of the views and information gathered to inform the Neighbourhood Plan questionnaire, which was issued in September 2016, and the Plan itself.   In addition to the engagement outlined above with the initial Community Conference, and questionnaires and drop in sessions on the SHLAA sites, we have throughout kept residents involved and informed through the monthly Parish magazine, and through our Neighbourhood Plan and Parish Council websites.\\nAt conferences and drop in sessions, members of the group have been there to engage personally with residents.\\nWe have also stressed throughout that new members are welcome and needed, and are pleased to have had new members joining.   On the wider spectrum of engagement, we encouraged residents to engage with Leeds City Council by advising them how take part in the SHLAA consultation and encouraging them to do so.\\nWe kept them advised of progress and developments within LCC as well as within our own group.   At every stage of consultation residents’ responses were retained and analysed, providing the basis for our vision and for the Neighbourhood Plan questionnaire, which was issued by volunteers to each of the 760 approx.\\nhouseholds in Bramham, during the summer of 2016.\\nCompleted questionnaires could be returned by Freepost, and also by handing in at our Village Shop, a focal point in Bramham.\\nWe were delighted that over 40% of households returned their completed questionnaires.\\nA summary of the responses is shown in the Consultation Statement Community Survey 2016.   A consultation event was held to discuss the draft vision, themes, objectives and policies in the Village Hall on 4th February 2017.\\n32 people attended the event which resulted in a number of useful discussions and comments.\\nThese comments were analysed by the steering group and were incorporated into the Plan where appropriate.   A business survey was conducted and a questionnaire was delivered to businesses within the parish in June 2017.\\n47 questionnaires were posted to local businesses whilst another 36 were made available at Bowcliffe Hall.\\nThe responses were analysed and are the results are shown in the Consultation Statement Bramham NDP Business Survey 2017.   In August 2017, the NPSG opened a conversation with University of Leeds with the aim of consulting on its future plans for the land that it owns in the south of the parish, that is currently used for agricultural research and education.   This continued engagement and ensuing responses have ensured that our Neighbourhood Plan has been developed using the views of local residents and local businesses at every step.\\nThis, and our use of Bramham’s well used community facilities and hubs, such as the Parish magazine, websites, the Village Hall and the Village Shop have resulted in a Neighbourhood Plan that is a true community product.

These were firstly an ecclesiastical system of parishes, usually coincident with one or more townships, with a church at the parish centre and secondly a manorial organisation which was not always so directly related to the township framework.\\nThe parish structure was largely in place in the Leeds area by the 11th century and remained relatively unchanged until the urban growth of the industrial period.   The ownership of land and the attendant manorial framework, however, were subject to continual change.\\nThis changing pattern of ownership and tenurial organisation through the Middle Ages and later, led amongst other things, to the unusually large number of 17th-18th century park estates, which still survive in the belt from Harewood in the north, through Bramham and Parlington, round to the south-east side of the District at Ledston and Temple Newsam.\\nToday, features such as manor houses, moated buildings, gardens, castles, mills, fishponds and deer parks still survive from this time.\\nLocal buildings in Bramham were historically built with Magnesian Limestone, although more recently, brick and other materials are used.   In 2010 study by Natural England3 looked at green infrastructure corridors for Yorkshire and the Humber.\\nIt determined that much of the area surrounding Bramham village, (although not the village itself), including Bramham Park, was designated by S19 Limestone Ridge (see map 4: Green Infrastructure Corridor Map4 ). The Limestone Ridge is a subregional corridor which runs from the south of Doncaster to Wetherby.\\nMost of the corridor is rural and it is characterised by large blocks of woodland and rolling farmland bounded by hedges and distinctive limestone buildings.\\nThere are also a number of parkland estates including Bramham and, as such, the area has both landscape and historical importance.   Bramham is located within the Magnesian Limestone Belt and is further characterised by gently rolling fields of arable which are bordered by low gappy hedgerows and isolated hedgerow trees, with small pockets of intact pasture occurring around the village fringes.\\nIt is surrounded by open arable farmland which typically occurs in the lower lying and gently rolling eastern pans of the district, including east Bramham.\\nThe openness of the farmland and lack of woodland allows for long uninterrupted views.   Bramham Moor was unenclosed until the nineteenth century but is now enclosed and cultivated, forming a productive area of large regular fields, interrupted by occasional woodland and patches of pasture.   Map 4: Green infrastructure corridors (Natural England)   The main watercourses that run directly through Bramham are Carr Beck and Bramham Beck.\\nThe Environment Agency’s flood maps (map 5 and map 6) indicate that there is a low risk of flooding from rivers and seas and a medium risk of flooding from surface water.   3http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140605112209/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/regions/yorkshire_and_ the_humber/ourwork/yandhgreeninfrastructuremappingproject.aspx '), ('d98c3869-d6f1-4e2c-b9d8-f970425b9e29', 'Barwick in Elmet & Scholes', '61', 'Household and Dwelling Characteristics > Figure 8a: accommodation type – (number of households)', ' Accommodation type   Barwick in Elmet   Leeds   Yorkshire and The   England   and Scholes '), ('1f54f568-c1ac-45d8-9c47-5cbd0b1f48c5', 'Collingham', '93', '19.

Memorial board    Percy Cross    In February, in heavy snow, Percy’s army marched towards York. Sir Thomas Rokeby, High Sheriff of Yorkshire, heard of Percy’s approach and raised his own army, and blocked the bridge at Knaresborough. Percy’s army advanced through Boroughbridge and Wetherby, and was being pursued by the King’s men, so he went on to Tadcaster, until he stopped and positioned his men on Bramham Moor to await the arrival of Rokeby and his men. The battle started at 2pm, and although it was short, it was said to be furious and bloody. It is generally believed that Rokeby led the charge against Percy and began a violent spree of hand-to-hand combat. Percy’s army was rapidly defeated with Lord Bardolph being fatally wounded and Percy himself lost his life, either by being killed in action or captured and then quickly executed.    The spot where Percy fell was subsequently marked by a memorial stone cross, which was removed to a wood on the edge of the battlefield as it interfered with the farmers’ cultivation of the land.    Moves are afoot to move the cross into the village  where it will better protected and appreciated by  villagers and visitors to the battlefield.    5http://historicbramham.org.uk/battle-of-bramham-moor3.html    Our survey showed that 82% (245 people) wanted the battle of Bramham Moor site and memorial stone to be protected. This Plan therefore identifies the Bramham Moor Battlefield, as specified on map 8, as a valued landscape area. This identification is the equivalent of that covered by the previous policy    H1 for non-designated local heritage assets and has been informed by the same criteria published by Historic England in their Local Heritage Listing Advice Note 7 (May 2016). However, there are key differences in the nature of the site compared to other proposed local heritage assets, and the Steering Group decided to create a separate policy for the Battlefield, recognising:    The extensive nature of the battlefield. The lack of certainty of its precise boundaries i.e. where the battle started or finished.     The essential nature of the land which is almost entirely agricultural with few physical features that distinguish it as an heritage asset from other parts of the adjoining countryside.   In summary, the area covered is recognised for the importance of the historic events that took place there, not for any remaining physical features.   In that non-designated heritage assets are identified by the local planning authority, the Parish Council will nominate the Battlefield and provide the supporting evidence to the City Council for inclusion in the Schedule of non-designated heritage assets maintained by the Council as part of the AMR.   Policy H2 provides protection for the integrity and historic interpretation of the Battlefield as a valued landscape area.   33BRAMHAM NEIGHBOURHOOD DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2018-2033 '), ('ed21fef1-fbd3-45ca-af5e-de53c9343ce7', 'Bramham cum Oglethorpe', '126', 'NE2: Enhancement and protection of nature areas and biodiversity > H1: Non designated local heritage assets > 4.5 Heritage (H) > H2: Bramham Moor Battlefield – Local Heritage Area', ' Objectives addressed   To retain and enhance the historic character and appeal of the existing conservation area and unique assets of the Parish.\\nAs well as the already known Roman road that runs through the Parish, a section of the route between Tadcaster and Ilkley, two further roads have been discovered.\\nThese came to light as a result of excavations carried out by the West Yorkshire Archeological Service and were commissioned by Northern Powergrid prior to the latter installing new pylons on Bramham Moor.\\nThese three Roman Roads are marked on map 7 below.

To support the continuing use of the University of Leeds Estate for agricultural/research/ academic purposes and other developments which comply with Policy UoL.1  There are three main areas of built development at the site as illustrated in the site plan (Map 16: University of Leeds site map): • Wise Warren Farm - the farm comprises an occupied house and a series of outbuildings that are predominantly unused (see map 16).        Bramham has a unique character that must be preserved and enhanced wherever possible. This does not mean that new ideas and materials should be dismissed but these need to be considered alongside high levels of design to ensure that the unique character of Bramham is never lost. Any alterations, extensions or additions to the built environment need to be carefully considered in order for them to help maintain and enhance the overall appeal of the parish.   b) Reflect local building design, form and style.\\nc) Where possible, reflect the best design within those parts of the Conservation Area, adjacent to the proposed development.\\nd) Take full account of heritage buildings and other assets.\\ne) Encourage innovative building design where appropriate.   c) Where possible, reflect the best design within those parts of the Conservation Area, adjacent to the proposed development. d) Take full account of heritage buildings and other assets. e) Encourage innovative building design where appropriate.    Outside the Conservation Area, there are the areas of housing on the north side of the village together with small pockets of housing elsewhere. The original council estate is a great asset to the village with solidly built houses. Their unique character with spacious gardens especially onto Clifford Road need to be retained. Similarly, the newer estates within the parish have a character of their own. Although they are not unique in their design and similar examples can be found throughout the country they add to diversity of the area.   f) To be supported development proposals must demonstrate they will not result in additional on-street parking of vehicles.   f) To be supported development proposals must demonstrate they will not result in additional on-street parking of vehicles.    The principles of design and detailing of all structures within the Conservation Area should be extended to the remainder of the parish in order that the unique nature of the village is never lost nor dwarfed by buildings of a different nature surrounding the conservation area. In particular, the small hamlet around Headley Hall is quite unique and care should be taken to ensure that it does not lose its appeal owing to its existing character. The parish is a small community in rural surroundings but the existing small spaces within the actual village are vital to the overall appearance and character that we aim to retain and enhance. The spaces are of equal importance to the actual buildings and it is not only the actual spaces enclosed by the buildings but the views that are to be seen between these structures. Over recent years, many spaces have been lost, gardens have been built on and many views blocked. This has had a detrimental effect on the appearance of the village and care must be taken to ensure that the overall character is not destroyed. It is essential that spaces between buildings are given a high priority when consideration is given to any planning application for extensions and in fills. It is not merely the buildings that make the village unique it is the roads, footpaths, courts and spaces between structures that add to the character and well-being of the parish.    The design and detailing of all external spaces are as important as the design of actual buildings that surround them, (including car parking spaces). The character of the area can be greatly enhanced by the detailing of street furniture and materials. The street scene is very important. Care needs to be taken to retain areas of paving and setts and not replacing them with tarmac. The existing stone walls around the parish need to be protected and kept in good order as they add to the character of the parish. Of specific importance are the walls bounding Aberford Road, Windmill Hill and Bowcliffe Road.

These views should be protected.    2. From village square, south towards Almshouse Hill    aim to protect view of traditional village buildings dating from the village’s early history and the war memorial.    The CAAMP notes the importance of key views as follows: “Despite the gradient of Town Hill, Bramham village effectively nestles in a distinct hollow and is therefore not highly visible within the wider landscape, though good views into the village are possible from the outer edges of the settlement. From within the village itself Town Hill and Almshouse Hill offer commanding views of the houses around the historic core, and views out of the village toward the surrounding agricultural and park land are always important.”    3. From the Jubilee Gardens, south towards village centre – aim to protect view of traditional dwellings leading to village square.    4. From cattle ramp towards the Red Lion public house – aim to protect view of historic cattle ramp, Carr Beck, public house, and square.    5. From village square towards Senior Citizens’ Centre and garden – aim to protect view of traditional building and green space in the heart of the village facing the square.    6. From Lyndon Road incorporating green space and then north towards Clifford – aim to protect view of green space on Lyndon Road and rural aspect to north of village.    In addition, the Core Strategy Policy P10: Design, states that development will protect and enhance locally important buildings, spaces, skylines and views. There are eight key short range views and nine key long range views in to and out of Bramham. These are illustrated in map 13 and map 14 and noted as follows: 7. From the junction of Aberford Road and Freely Lane looking north up Freely Lane – aim to protect view of Historic building (Bramham Lodge) and playing field opposite.    8.

Policies summarised    UoL1: University of Leeds Estate    Objectives addressed    The University of Leeds have owned or leased the majority of the land identified on the site location plan (Map 15 University of Leeds estate boundary) since around the 1940s. The site was originally predominantly used for teaching and research on arable, dairy and pig production.    In the 1990s, the University leased much of the land to a wholly owned subsidiary company called the University of Leeds Farms Ltd. However, since this point the use of the farms for teaching has broadly declined. Many of the current buildings within the site are vacant and in need of repair, e.g. Wise Warren Farm.    13% (39 respondents) answered, I am against all forms of development associated with renewable energy within Bramham Parish.    49% (145 respondents) answered, yes, providing it is small scale and out of sight.    The University are currently in the process of dissolving the University of Leeds Farms Ltd and developing a new estate strategy. The intention is to dissolve the limited company with a view to managing the estate within the Facilities Directorate under a new structure. The research activities will bring some buildings on the three existing farms back into use where possible. However, it is likely that some vacant buildings will need to be converted to other viable uses (eg residential). There is the potential to convert the existing agricultural barns at Wise Warren Farm to dwellings.

The style of building moved from the Edwardian (e.g. Compton Terrace on School Lane) to the more ‘Suburban Modernist’ style of the 1930s (e.g. Old Brookside, Garth End, houses on Linton Road).\\nHouses were mostly brick built and rendered.   4. 1946 – 1975   28.8 This is the period when Collingham saw its largest growth.\\nBuilding started immediately after the War, initially in Garth Avenue, which displays a wide range of styles but with the majority of houses built in stone.\\nThese houses were mostly built by Peter Charnock, who also built many of the houses in Crabtree Green during the 1950s.   28.9 The largest developments of this period were Hollybush Green and Jewitt Lane in the late 1950s/early 1960s and Millbeck Green in the 1960s both built by E. Fish & Son (Builders) Ltd who later went on to develop the paddocks around Beck House on Church Lane and the land previously occupied by part of the Coal Yard on Station Lane.   28.10 The style of these houses has come to characterize the ‘Collingham Style’ i.e.\\nhouses built in reclaimed stone with asymmetrical forward-facing gables with stepped corbels, occasional round-headed or circular windows and Roman arches to porches and side entrances.   28.11 Many of the doorways in Millbeck Green have Palladian Porches with a pediment.\\nThese sit rather uneasily with the asymmetrical style of the houses.   5. 1976 – 2000   28.12 During this period most of the development in Collingham took place in the new Estates of Bishopdale, adjoining Lower Langwith and the Kingfishers on Linton Road.\\nThis possibly reflects the re-siting of the Primary School in the 1960s to its present position at the junction of Linton Road and Harewood Road, as both estates are very near the School.

Neighbourhood Plans are part of a raft of new community rights to enable local communities to better shape their places.   A Neighbourhood Plan can be used to decide where new development takes place, what type it should be and what it should look like, together with other matters of local interest such as open space and community facilities.\\nIt cannot be used to stop development already allocated or permitted, or propose less development than that in the Local Plan (principally, the Leeds Core Strategy and Site Allocations Plan).\\nIt could, however, propose more development than the Local Plan if a community was so minded.\\nNeighbourhood Plans also provide the opportunity for communities to set out other non-planning actions and aspirations so that the resultant document presents a holistic framework for the future of an area over the next 10 to 15 years (up to 2028 in the case of Aberford).   The process of producing a plan also provides an opportunity for communities to work with their District Council on the allocation of sites as well as other corporate objectives, such as improving equality, cohesion and integration and recognising diversity.   Once adopted, the plan forms part of the statutory Local Plan (The Leeds Local Plan) and carries real legal weight in decisions on planning applications and planning appeals.   The decision to produce a Neighbourhood Plan for Aberford was taken by Aberford and District Parish Council on 17th January 2012 in response to the Government’s publication of the Localism Bill, on the grounds that it would enable the community to have more of a say in the future development of the local area, albeit within certain limits and parameters.\\nIt was felt that taking the step to produce a plan was a necessary move forward in order to protect and form the future shape of the village, allowing local residents to air their views throughout the process.\\nThis imperative was strengthened by Leeds City Council’s work on a Local Plan and a search for housing sites, several of which were initially identified within the parish.

While small scale improvements will prolong the life of the hall in the short term and monies have been identified for refurbishment works, the trustees’ view is that the hall needs substantial investment to secure its long term future.\\nIn recent years, the trustees have worked closely with the owner of the land behind the hall to submit a joint planning application to build additional housing for the village, while also providing much needed off-road parking for the village hall, together with a substantial cash payment to enable a major refurbishment of the hall.\\nFollowing refusal of planning permission by Leeds City Council and the subsequent rejection of an appeal by a Government inspector, these plans have now been abandoned.

The magnesian limestone to the east of Leeds is rich farming land and it is probable that the area was cultivated by the Romans.   It seems likely that the origin of the name Garforth is Anglo-Saxon.\\nThe two words mean “ford by a triangular piece of land”.\\nThe whole area was annexed by the Kingdom of Northumbria in AD 617.\\nSome evidence of settlement was found near Parlington Hollins in advance of the construction of the A1-M1 link, but the evidence suggested a loosely arranged community rather than a “village”.   The first detailed description of Garforth comes in the Domesday Survey compiled in 1086.\\nThe manor of Garforth was 1.5 miles long and 1.5 miles wide.\\nThere was a church, a priest, 4 villagers and 1 smallholder.\\nAs only heads of families were counted the figures are an underestimate for the population of the village.   Slight traces of the medieval field system can still be seen as ridge and furrow in grassed areas such as Garforth Golf Course.   The ownership of the land changed a number of times and, eventually, by the late 18th century was largely in the hands of the Gascoigne family, where it remained.   There had been mining in the area for some time, probably since the 13th century, but the Gascoigne family extended the scope of mining, although, at this stage the mining was not deep.\\nHowever, between 1830 and 1840 the first shafts were sunk, and mining began on a more industrial scale.   The population increased significantly to reflect the work available in the pits.\\nIn 1831 the population was 782; by 1899 it was 3,224, an increase of 400% in 70 years.   There was significant flooding at the colliery in the 1870s and 1880s and the pits eventually closed in 1930.   There was a large surge in house building in the 1960s and 1970s on land surrounding Garforth.\\nThe town provided a convenient location with relatively affordable housing and good transport links to the city of Leeds and beyond More recent expansion can be traced to a combination of overall economic success in Leeds and Garforth’s excellent transport links.\\nThe two railway stations allow easy and quick access to Leeds.\\nThe A1 and M1 pass nearby and in 1999 the roads were linked by the extension of the M1 which passes to the west and north of Garforth.\\nUnusually there are two motorway junctions, each within less than a mile of Garforth.\\nThe M1 extension has led to rapid development of commercial, light industrial and residential sites clustered around Junctions 46 and 47.\\nIn addition the M62 is less than 10 miles away.

We believe it is reasonable to quote this information as there has been recent wage restraint for many years.\\nAverage wages were quoted as being per annum:  • City centre £16,587;  • The golden triangle £34,959;  • The inner area £17,241;  • The outer area £27,907; and  • Leeds average £24,173     2.57 Using the illustration above and taking into account the parish house price information and these average income levels, it is clear that most households in Leeds are priced out of the parish housing market unless they have significant savings or equity in their current home.   2.58 Although there is relatively little rented housing in the parish it is helpful to understand the affordability of rented housing.\\nGovernment practice guidance suggests that 25% of household income or less should be affordable to households.\\nSo a household income equivalent to the minimum wage would suggest that the household should pay no more than £250 per calendar month (pcm).\\nSuch households would seek to close the gap between this and market rents by claiming housing benefit.   2.59 Further, most letting agents use a different method for assessing whether a prospective tenant can afford the tenancy on offer.\\nTheir starting point is the rent not the tenant’s income.\\nThey multiply the rent by 30 to arrive at the minimum income that would be required without a guarantor.\\nThis means that a rent of say, £400 pcm requires an income of £12,000 pa which is close to the minimum wage.\\nTenants with lower incomes than 30 times rent will require a guarantor in addition to a tenancy deposit.\\nHowever practice guidance would suggest that someone on this income should reasonably be able to afford a rent of £250.   The discrepancy between practice guidance and industry practice is noteworthy and means that the tenant will pay 1.6 times more rent than the government suggests they can reasonably afford.   2.60 This above explains why many younger people will struggle to achieve home ownership in the early stages of their working lives and rely upon the private rented sector to supply the housing they can afford.\\nThe absence of a large private rented sector in the parish coupled with a low proportion of smaller homes means that the parish does not have a housing offer that is either suitable for or affordable to the majority of younger households seeking housing.\\nThere is a good supply of rented housing in the wider Leeds housing market area.

Interpreting local need estimates, policy considerations and conclusion   7.14 Housing surveys have been relied upon for decades as the main method of estimating local housing requirements.\\nMore recently the approach is used in smaller geographies such as wards and parishes rather than boroughs, districts and cities.\\nThis study develops the basic approach as it looks across all of the housing tenures to arrive at a net requirement for additional housing rather than a narrow focus on the need for social or affordable housing.\\nThe key finding is that the underlying cause the requirement for additional housing because there is a mismatch between the size type and tenure of potential vacancies to the requirements of households that plan to move home.   7.15 It is important to recognise that this is a snapshot of household circumstances aspirations.\\nThe method cannot take account of unexpected change in housing requirements due to, for example relationship breakdown or household dissolution due to death.   7.16 The estimate of local need is an estimate not a probability.\\nIt should be regarded as an order of magnitude and not be applied prescriptively.\\nTaking the survey findings and the supporting evidence into account there is very strong evidence to support policies that address imbalances in the parish household and dwelling profile and its predicted demographic change.   7.18 The evidence base that has been produced contains significant and wide ranging information to enable the parish council and the public to consider housing policy and development proposals in an informed way.

Strategy and Site Allocations Plan, provides the policy basis for the vision set out in the Holbeck SPD for that area; in particular, the aim to:   • “create a mixed-use, sustainable community with a distinctive sense of place, which exemplifies best practice in regeneration and sustainable development;   • improve … links to the surrounding communities of Beeston Hill and Holbeck;   • create new opportunities for employment and skills, living and leisure, and;   • further enable the growth of key economic sectors in the area, including creative and digital, high quality and modern manufacturing”.   3.1.5 The South Bank Planning Framework, due to be adopted in 2017, also sets out a direction for the development of the wider area, including the Holbeck SPD area and thus part of this Neighbourhood Plan area.   3.1.6 Regeneration in Holbeck is also aimed at improving the health and well-being of residents.\\nImprovements in social cohesion, integration, housing, employment and training can all have significant positive effects on health.   3.1.7 Further regeneration is required, continuing and expanding the work currently taking place.\\nA more attractive and healthier place for all means firstly taking steps to identify and preserve Holbeck\\\\'s assets: its distinctive qualities, its heritage and its green spaces.\\nWhere improvement is needed, the Neighbourhood Plan includes policies and projects to help bring this about.   3.1.8 A distinctive and successful local centre as a focus for a neighbourhood helps provide identity, as do the facilities that enable a community to be more cohesive and mutually supportive; places for people of all ages to meet and enjoy on a formal and informal basis.\\nThe Neighbourhood Plan includes policies and projects to strengthen the function and use of the local centre and community facilities, to mitigate the effects of traffic and make it easier, safer and more pleasant to walk and cycle in the area. \"), ('ab5b7e31-71a6-495d-a063-92dd69b405e0', 'Holbeck', '119', '5.

G: HOUSING TYPE > Objectives to help deliver the Vision for Collingham > Justification and Evidence', ' 17.1 Core Strategy Policy H4 – Housing Mix requires developments to address needs measured over the longer term taking into account the nature of the development and character of the location.   17.2 Within Collingham there is already a greater concentration of elderly people than the Leeds and national average.\\nThe population of Collingham is described by the census information included in Table 1.   17.3 This indicates the population is becoming older, and the proportion over 75 at 12.8% is already higher than that in Wetherby (10.6%) and much higher than that across Leeds (7.0%).\\nCurrently 20.7% of residents in Collingham are between the ages of 60 and 75.\\nAssuming residents choose to remain in Collingham then the proportion of over 75 is very likely to be even greater at the end of the Plan period.   17.4 Conversely, the proportion of people of ‘family building’ age (25 – 44) is almost half the city average, and there has been a significant reduction in this demographic over ten years.   17.5 Over the Plan period it is estimated that there will be a 16% increase in households over 65; a 30% increase in over 75s, a 70% increase in over 85s (see CS paragraph 5.2.39).   17.6 The logical conclusion from these statistics is that there will be a demand for suitable housing for an ageing population and for those that wish to move, this demand is likely to be for smaller dwellings.   17.7 This conclusion is shared by Leeds Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) Update (GVA and Edge Analytics, May 2011).\\nThe SHMA analysis suggests that Leeds is likely to see a continued growth in single person and couple households, with a relatively small rise in family households.\\nThe analysis also points to a rising demand for smaller properties based on the projected increase in couple and single person households.\\nIn total, it is estimated that 55% of demand for new stock will be for two-bedroom properties.   17.8 Table 2 shows the housing stock in the Parish compared with the housing stock across Leeds.\\nThis shows a relative deficit in the number of smaller properties.\\nDue to the characteristics of the area it is not reasonable to expect the deficit to be removed completely, but this does show the type of housing which is likely to be required.   17.9 The Parish Council considers that proposals should therefore include smaller housing designed to the latest accessible housing standards and that consideration should be given towards the provision of level access flats, bungalows and sheltered housing schemes.

If we look at how people travel in our region today their journeys do not always seem to go smoothly.\\nThere are often issues with traffic jams, parking problems, delayed or cancelled trains and buses not running to time.\\nPerhaps some of the issues could be partly resolved by people making different travel choices.   2. Public transport is widely used- although often maligned- and there is undoubtedly scope for improvement with regard to reliability and pricing.\\nHowever, the notion that walking or cycling could form part of our journey planning is still alien to many people.\\nPart of the issue is habit.\\nPart is (perceived) convenience.\\nBut an even greater barrier is the lack of adequate infrastructure for walking and cycling.   3. If this key issue can be addressed, the benefits to the individual and to society in terms of better health and less pollution would be considerable.   4. Looking at Garforth, it seems sensible to consider how we could help make it easier for people to make the best transport choice for the journey they are making whether within the town or beyond.   5. Clearly, the notion of “best transport choice” may have different meanings for different people.\\nHowever, given that we are all responsible for the choices we make and given the current crises in our country with regard to obesity and health in general, it would seem sensible that good transport choices would not contribute to worsening the situation with regard to these national problems.\\nIf you add in the issues of global warming and air pollution caused by vehicle emissions, it seems clear that we can begin to see what a good travel choice might imply.   6. The National Planning Policy Framework is unequivocal here.\\nParagraph112 states, “applications for development should: a) give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and with neighbouring areas; and second – so far as possible – to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for bus or other public transport services, and appropriate facilities that encourage public transport use’’   7. In summary, when considering journeys people make in and around Garforth it is feasible to encourage people to make choices about how they travel which will benefit both themselves in terms of their health and wellbeing and the planet in terms of reducing emissions.

A Housing Needs Assessment undertaken by Chris Broughton Associates in 2015 provided the following key information about the housing characteristics and needs of the parish:  1. The evidence suggests that the parish has many features that distinguish it from the city, the region and England.\\nCompared to these larger geographies the key differences are:  over the decade between the 2001 and 2011 censuses the parish population has declined even though the number of households increased, due to decreasing average household size;  there are fewer young children and young adults;  there are considerably more people over the age of 65;  people that are economically active are more likely to be in higher and medium level occupations;  people are healthier and are less likely to have limitations in their day to day activities even though there is a high proportion of older residents in the parish.  2. In respect of the housing stock, the parish:  has a very high proportion of detached houses and bungalows with a very low proportion of terraced homes, flats and apartments;  has a high proportion (over 75%) of homes that have 3 bedrooms or more;  generates a low supply of re-sales and re-lets as households tend to stay resident in the parish long term;  generates high demand, driven by easy access to labour markets by road, a high quality environment and good schools.\\nThe parish is described as ‘a place to move up to’.  is consequently more expensive than average prices for Leeds and the region  is unlikely to be affordable to households on average income unless they can find significant deposits; and  is unlikely to be affordable to first time buyers.      3. There is little supply of social or affordable housing in the parish.\\nAlthough many households on the waiting list for social housing aspire to live in the parish, limited supply from relets means that there is only a small amount of active demand.  4. The main priorities for residents of the parish in respect of housing provision were for future homes to have on plot parking; a private garden; high standards of energy efficiency; a garage; be suited for first time buyers and older people.\\nResidents felt that town houses and large family homes should be a low priority.  5. The information showed that over the next five years more housing would become vacant in the parish than was required by local households seeking to move home within the parish.\\nHowever because of the limited diversity in the housing stock and choices made by aging households to downsize there was a mismatch between the likely supply of housing and the requirement of households seeking to move.\\nThe mismatch occurs in terms of house size, type, tenure and special features.     61Barwick in Elmet and Scholes Neighbourhood Plan 2016 '), ('df986791-efbc-4093-91f6-1ca20a9d40bb', 'Collingham', '84', '19.

The objectives of the plan include maintaining, improving and increasing the provision of green spaces, promoting healthy lifestyles, protecting and maintaining access to the green infrastructure around Garforth, protecting and enhancing the rural environment, landscape and the habitats network around Garforth.   2. Easy and safe access to local parks, allotments, outdoor sporting venues, safe children’s play facilities and high-quality open spaces are vital to the health and wellbeing of a community enabling social interaction, play and recreational activities.\\nRegular exercise, sporting and leisure activities, particularly outdoors, are critical to maintaining active and healthy lifestyles.   3. Green spaces provide the infrastructure necessary to support the growth of trees, hedges and other vegetation to improve air quality, carbon sequestration and flood risk mitigation, all of which contribute to the solutions necessary to address the climate emergency.   4. The rural environment, a natural heritage, also provides opportunities for sustaining wildlife especially pollinating insects vital to food production.   5. The Covid pandemic has highlighted the importance of accessible green spaces for physical and mental health.\\nMedical journals state that it is not just physical exercise but activity in a green environment and engagement with nature that is essential to preserve health and the Office of National Statistics (ONS) has stated that one in eight households do not have access to their own garden1.   6. The key benefits of green space are:  • Natural heritage, providing opportunities for wildlife opportunities for addressing health and wellbeing inequalities  • Social sustainability and opportunities for social interaction  • Play and recreation  • Climate change mitigation and reduction  • Flood risk mitigation; and  • Air quality improvements and carbon sequestration.     7. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s report on the Social Value of Public Spaces2 outlines the benefits of public space to the cultural and social life of communities, finding that parks and open public spaces are integral to the creation of a local identity and better sense of place.   8. The University of Leeds Guide to the benefits of Urban Green Spaces 3 states:   “Urban green spaces such as domestic gardens, parks and woodland provide a multitude of benefits to urban populations and a vital habitat for wildlife.\\nBy improving physical fitness and reducing depression, the presence of green spaces can enhance the health and wellbeing of people.\\nGreen spaces also indirectly impact on health by improving air quality and limiting the impact of heatwaves by reducing urban temperatures.\\nIn addition, urban vegetation stores carbon, helping to mitigate climate change and reduces the likelihood of flooding by storing excess water.”   9.

The extent of this can be seen in the geological map below, believed to be dated 1840 and in the 1934 Ordnance Survey Map.    Ganister Quarry    The ganister quarry was located to the north and west of the top of Hunger Hills Wood. There are fine long-distance views over it from Hunger Hills Wood, especially to the south-west. See image 1 below. Visually there remain elevated spoil heaps next to the quarry’s boundary with the Hunger Hills Wood, these being seen best from the vantage points of images 2 and 3 below. It is likely that archaeological work near to the spoil heaps would uncover buildings and equipment structures that are covered over. It is believed that the quarry was filled-in progressively after 1948 by local waste removal and land fill.

There is a need then to become, as far as is practicable, ‘open for business’ as far as small business is concerned where impacts upon residential areas is often minimal. Evidence    Nearly 200 people are employed by local businesses currently according to surveys, and this is likely to be a considerable under representation. There are over 160 VAT registered businesses in the parish with more that are not registered and, therefore, more or less invisible. Main Street in Barwick in Elmet and Station Road in Scholes are both home to a variety of retail and service businesses. Agriculture is the major commercial land use in the Neighbourhood Area. Land cultivated is primarily held by tenant farmers and agricultural viability should be preserved. The land farmed has good rates of crop production averaging above 4 ton of wheat per acre. Some land is also used for oil seed rape and potatoes, with small areas used for grazing.   The villages benefit from a number of economic sites, primarily on the enterprise park on Aberford Road in Barwick in Elmet and on York Road at Morwick Hall in Scholes. Morwick Hall and the surrounding annexes provide thirty varied business users with accommodation. The development of a business ‘start-up site’ for eighteen light industrial units and a training block has been proposed at Holmecroft, located on a brownfield site, a former scrap yard adjacent to the A64. Langland’s Garden Centre and other commercial enterprises are also located on the A64. Retail outlets are also established in both villages, primarily in the village centres and along the main thoroughfares. In addition there are also numerous small and home based businesses including plumbers, electricians, accountancy and other sole traders who have been consulted throughout the preparation of this plan.

      "In 2017, over 95% of respondents to the draft plan consultation supported the policy to protect and enhance ‘Local Green Infrastructure’.   The Leeds Core Strategy recognises the importance of the surrounding green space (and inherent links – including some of those identified by the community), identifies much of it as ‘The Limestone Ridge’ and designates it as ‘Strategic Green Infrastructure’ (see The Neighbourhood Plan Map).\n",

      "text:   The designated Local Green Spaces were considered with a view to possible enhancement in order to improve their value to the local community, a policy approach supported by almost 87% of respondents in the draft plan consultation.   In July 2011, the Leeds Open Space, Sport and Recreation Assessment rated Aberford Playing Fields and Tennis Courts and St Ricarius Churchyard (Cattle Lane) as ‘poor’, with Aberford Church of England Primary School (playing fields), Aberford Allotments (Field Lane) and St Ricarius Church (School Lane) only ‘fair’.\n",
      "In the years following, Aberford Playing Fields and Tennis Courts and Aberford Allotments have both been subject to improvement and are now considered by the parish council to be in ‘good’ condition.\n",
      "Based on a 2016 community assessment of sites, the condition of sites overall is considered to have improved.\n",
      "The assessment is detailed in the plan’s online evidence base.   Leeds Core Strategy Policy G4 (New Green Space Provision) states that in areas of adequate green space supply such as Aberford (ref the Leeds July 2011 assessment), contributions of an equivalent value towards the safeguarding and improvement of existing green space will take priority over the creation of new areas.\n",
      "In this circumstance, qualitative improvements would be needed to address the pressures placed upon existing green space in the form of increased usage and increased demand arising from new residential development.   Neighbourhood Plan Policy GE4 adds local flavour to Policy G4 through the identification of specific sites in need of enhancement, based on the 2016 assessment’s identification of ‘poor’ and ‘fair’ sites.   In 2015, the community overwhelmingly endorsed a policy intention which included the provision of ‘new, meaningful green space’ linked to new developments.\n",
      "The green space needs of Leeds District have been identified in the aforementioned Leeds 2011 assessment.\n",
      "This showed that Aberford is adequately catered for in all categories of green space and recreation (relative to applicable standards) with the exception of indoor sports facilities.\n",
      "Given Aberford’s current size and population, it is clearly unreasonable to expect the provision of such a facility within the village.\n",
      "Core Strategy Policy G4 states that new on-site provision of green space at a standard of 80 square metres per residential unit will be sought on development sites of 10 or more dwellings on sites outside the city centre and in excess of 720 metres from a community park.\n",
      "This policy is likely to cover Aberford’s future needs and there is no evidenced reason to vary from the standards which would be applied.\n",

      "These highlighted near unanimous support for protecting the war memorial, Drovers’ Verges and St Ricarius Church as well as revealing concerns regarding the possible loss of heritage assets.\n",
      "The 2015 consultation on policy intentions garnered 93% support for a policy to protect historical features and suggested a number of candidate buildings and structures for consideration.\n",
      "In 2017 over 92% of respondents supported a policy to protect and where possible enhance non-statutory heritage assets.\n",
      "Specific comments were additionally made (including by Historic England) regarding the area’s rich archaeological heritage, with particular reference to a medieval settlement at Parlington and to Iron Age/Roman and post-medieval remains.   Aberford is well-blessed in terms of its individual heritage buildings, structures and archaeological sites.\n",
      "It contains 3 grade II* (including the Gascoigne Almshouses and Warden’s Cottage) and 41 grade II listed buildings; 8 Scheduled Monuments (including 3 grade I sites at Becca Banks and an Iron Age Romano-British settlement); plus 2 Registered Historic Parks in Lotherton Hall and the Parlington Estate.\n",
      "All are protected in law and are documented on the Historic England website.\n",
      "All also enjoy protection via Core Strategy Policy P11 (Conservation) and the saved policies of the Leeds Unitary Development Plan (UDP - N14-17).\n",
      "Many other buildings within the conservation area are identified as ‘positive buildings’ within the CAAMP.   Other buildings and historical features and sites however, such as St Ricarius South Churchyard, Hillam Burchard Medieval Settlement and Water Mill Water Control Features, and including many within the Parlington Estate (eg WWII Structures, The Fly Line), remain relatively unprotected against unsympathetic development.\n",
      "A list including some of these formed part of Appendix 2 of the 2013 Aberford and District Village Design Statement (VDS), based on which an updated list with assessments of each (based on Historic England Local Heritage Listing guidance) is included here at Appendix 4.\n",
      "Based on these assessments, a total of 17 assets were adjudged to meet Historic England criteria.\n",
      "The Neighbourhood Plan will therefore introduce policy in order to seek to protect what makes these ‘Non-Designated Heritage Assets’ important and to encourage appropriate enhancement.\n",
      "This is in the context of NPPF para 135 and will add to UDP and in particular Core Strategy policy, which applies equally to statutory and non-designated assets, and which aims in particular to encourage enhancement, regeneration and positive action in respect of under-utilised assets.   In respect of archaeological heritage, it is clear from West Yorkshire Archaeological Advisory Service (WYAAS) data (see online evidence base) that aside from statutory sites and the Hillam Burchard Medieval Settlement covered by BH2 below, there are other non-statutory sites (eg at Parlington, Lotherton and Beccamoor Wood) considered to be of special archaeological value and potentially worthy of preservation in situ, but which are difficult to reliably identify and define on the ground at this time.\n",
      "As such, this plan relies on Core Strategy Policy P11 (Conservation) to ensure that such archaeological remains are properly considered in any development proposals and are conserved and enhanced as appropriate. \n",

      "text:   In the 2013 Neighbourhood Plan consultation, respondents clearly indicated two main areas of local housing need, namely the elderly and first time buyers, with over a hundred responses in each case.\n",
      "The consultation on policy intentions in 2015 provided over 80% support for a policy addressing a mix of housing sizes, types and tenures to meet local housing needs, with mention again made of the needs of younger residents and young families for smaller properties.\n",
      "A similar number supported a proposed housing mix policy in the 2017 draft plan.   While no housing needs assessment has been carried out for Aberford, assessments have been completed for the comparable nearby parishes of Barwick and Scholes (a direct neighbour to the west) and Clifford, both within the Outer North East Housing Characteristic Area.\n",
      "Key conclusions of each in respect of the characteristics of housing needed may also reasonably be drawn for Aberford:-  • Younger households seeking to upgrade, with smaller households likely to need and/or afford smaller dwellings;  • An aging population living in larger homes seeking to downsize, coupled with increasing numbers of older people suggesting housing for independent living for older people likely to be in demand;  • Likely lesser demand for the very largest properties (4+ bedrooms);  • Higher demand for homes up to and including 3 bedrooms;  • A need for policies that address imbalances in the local household and dwelling profile and predicted demographic change.     Core Strategy policy on housing mix (Policy H4) states that development should include an appropriate mix of dwelling types and sizes to address needs measured over the long term, taking into account the character of the location.\n",
      "It further states that for developments over 250 units, in or adjoining the Main Urban Area and Major Settlements and for developments over 50 units in or adjoining ‘Smaller Settlements’, developers are required to submit a Housing Needs Assessment (HNA) addressing all tenures so that the needs of the locality can be taken into account at the time of development.\n",
      "It is assumed that this would cover any major housing development that may or may not be allocated in the Neighbourhood Area.   On smaller sites, however, there is no such HNA requirement and therefore no guarantee that locally evidenced needs would be met.\n",
      "Plan policy will address this situation.   Core Strategy Policy H8 addresses ‘Housing for Independent Living’ and states that developments of over 50 dwellings are expected to make a contribution to supporting needs for independent living, with very large developments having the potential to provide sheltered schemes and smaller developments contributing in other ways, such as bungalows or level access flats.\n",
      "Policy goes on to set more detailed locational requirements such as walking distances to town or local centres or access to community facilities.\n",
      "This policy should ensure that any housing development over the stated threshold will provide for elderly people’s needs and that new development would be appropriately provided for in relation to facilities.   The above does not however cover the needs of elderly people wishing to downsize in order to remain within Aberford village.\n",
      "Neighbourhood Plan policy will address this by reducing the dwelling threshold trigger. \n",

      "It lies seven miles to the north of Leeds and five miles to the south of Wetherby.\n",
      "According to the 2011 Census, and as a result of comparatively recent boundary changes (April 2014), there are now 787 houses in Scarcroft.\n",
      "The majority of these houses are of a traditional nature, built of stone, brick and render on good sized plots.\n",
      "It is perhaps surprising to note that its community services are poor.\n",
      "There is one public house, a cricket field and pavilion and a Village Hall.\n",
      "Scarcroft doesn’t have its own church, primary school (it relies on a combination of schools in the neighbouring villages) post office, or shop.\n",
      "The 2011 Census advises us that the population of Scarcroft is 1,217 people, of which 20% are over the age of 65 years and 70% are over 30 years, with 23% under the age of 19 years.\n",
      "The breakdown of these figures compares remarkably well with Thorner, our neighbouring village.\n",
      "It seems that Scarcroft, for all its differences, is by population make-up, a typical example of a Leeds village.   The A58 runs through the heart of the village, connecting Leeds with Wetherby.\n",
      "Whilst the A58 provides excellent road access to major cities, it does have the negative impact of dissecting the village.\n",
      "The village also lacks a main focus point due to the above-noted absence of community services.   At a village meeting in early 2012, local residents completed a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) that identified the need and desire to create a greater village focus.\n",
      "This was reiterated in the Village Questionnaire that was circulated to residents in July 2012, where the need for a shop was also strongly articulated.\n",
      "Respondents to the Village Questionnaire, some 123 people, identified that access to quality countryside and the footpath networks of the village is widely valued by the community.\n",
      "There was a strong demand for improved formal recreation and leisure space, from children’s play space to a park and allotments, as being beneficial to the fabric of the village.\n",
      "There is a strong sentiment from the survey that residents would prefer no new housing development in Scarcroft, although it was recognized that this ideal position is unlikely. \n",

      "Our parish can and should provide opportunities for local people to find housing, find employment and access opportunities for education, recreation and community activities, while maintaining the essential rural character of the parish and surrounding countryside.”   This same vision was again strongly endorsed by some 96% of respondents in the 2015 Neighbourhood Plan consultation on policy intentions.   In mid-2016, Leeds City Council’s proposals to pursue major new housing development in the area, in the form of a Parlington New Sustainable Settlement, prompted the updating of this vision, to take account of this significant possible change in local circumstances.\n",
      "A resultant new vision, with a set of aims designed to achieve the vision, were consulted on in the Pre-Submission Draft Plan, receiving some 79% support from respondents.   In the light of the parish council’s decision to now pursue a plan not specifically addressing a potential Parlington development, the following revised vision is set out, together with a set of aims designed to achieve the vision and to guide the development of neighbourhood plan policies to deliver those aims. \n",

Within Aberford’s green environment, there is much of intrinsic nature conservation value, from individual sites (e.g. Hook Moor Site of Special Scientific Interest, Parlington Hollins) and habitat features, such as ancient woodland and lowland calcareous grassland (both UK Priority Habitats and part of the Leeds Habitat Network), to specific species.\n",

      "The response to the June 2015 Policy Intentions Document consultation solidly endorsed (90%) a policy to achieve this end, as did the 2017 draft plan consultation (89%).   Core Strategy Policy P9 states that where proposals for development would result in the loss of an existing facility or service, satisfactory alternative provision should be made elsewhere within the community if a sufficient level of need is identified.\n",
      "Neighbourhood Plan policy will add to this by specifying the facilities or services to which policy will apply (ref Appendix 5 for full details) and the particular local circumstances which should govern loss or alternative provision, in particular the need for viability testing in respect of commercially provided facilities, such as a shop or public house.\n",
      "It will also address the particular concern that, given the village’s elongated linear form, essential facilities should be retained within a defined central core area of the village, within which most such existing facilities are currently located, in order to maintain accessibility.\n",
      "This is all within the context of amendments to the Use Classes Order in May 2017 which now permit changes in the use of the village’s facilities without the need for express planning permission, allowable changes which policy CF1 below reflects.   The central village core is shown on The Neighbourhood Plan Map.\n",

      "text:   1.3.1 A brief history of Alwoodley   Alwoodley parish includes part of the suburb known as Alwoodley in North Leeds, together with Eccup Reservoir and the rural area extending towards Harewood and Bramhope.\n",
      "Within the parish boundaries there is extensive farm land, Eccup Reservoir and woodland.\n",
      "The Reservoir, woodland and the network of footpaths in the parish are popular with the population of Leeds for recreational purposes.   There are two dedicated histories of Alwoodley, both written by residents of the parish in the early twenty-first century.\n",
      "They are An Illustrated History of Alwoodley (Leeds, 2005) by Stephen Burt and Alwoodley, Leeds: The History of a Twentieth Century Suburb (Leeds, 2004) by Graham Branston.\n",
      "Stephen Burt also produced Old Alwoodley in Photographs (Leeds 2004).\n",
      "What follows here is an edited version of a history based on these three sources and written by David Ellis.\n",
      "A full, comprehensively referenced version of the history is available on the Alwoodley Parish Council website.   The name Alwoodley is possibly of Saxon origin, meaning either “clearing in the alder wood” or “Athelward’s forest glade or clearing”.\n",
      "Alwoodley is referred to in the Domesday Book (1086) which reveals that the area was farmed in the late eleventh century by someone named Rosketill.\n",
      "In 1200 Adel Mill was the subject of a bitter legal dispute between the Abbot of Kirkstall and the Prior of Holy Trinity Priory, York.   From the Middle Ages until the end of the nineteenth century Alwoodley was ‘essentially a collection of dispersed farms with early enclosures, heath, marsh and woodland’ (Branston, 2004).\n",
      "Alwoodley was occupied by smallholders, eking out a meagre living in difficult conditions.\n",
      "The residents of the area farmed sheep and grew crops in sheltered places.   In the late medieval period, Alwoodley Old Hall was constructed and it was the seat of the Frank family until 1638 when it was sold to the Clifton family.\n",
      "The Hall was included in the land leased to Sandmoor Golf Club and it was demolished in 1969 due it its dilapidated state.\n",
      "Alwoodley was largely untouched by the industrial revolution, though on its borders Scotland Mill on Adel Beck was the place where flax was first spun with water powered machinery by John Marshall in the late eighteenth century.   In the 1840s, land acquired from the Earl of Harewood by the Leeds Waterworks Company was used to build Eccup Reservoir to provide the City of Leeds with clean drinking water.\n",
      "The reservoir was expanded in 1850 and again in the 1890s, bringing it to its present size.\n",
      "The reservoir became part of a system of reservoirs serving Leeds, most of which are located in the Washburn Valley.\n",
      "Four shafts, excluding the valve chamber, were constructed in Alwoodley to serve the tunnel from Eccup Reservoir to Seven Arches aqueduct.   6\n",
      "|\n",
      "P\n",
      "a g e   From the late nineteenth century, Alwoodley provided a rural retreat for residents of the expanding industrial city.\n",
      "Adel Crags and the Seven Arches Aqueduct were popular attractions in the area.\n",
      "Verity’s Tea Rooms in Adel Woods and Carrie’s Café on The Avenue provided refreshments to these tourists from the city.\n",
      "In the 1930s, several people built their own holiday homes in Alwoodley.\n",
      "The constructions were considered insanitary by the City Council and most were removed after the Second World War.   Until the 1920s, Alwoodley was part of the Wharfedale Rural District Council under the West Riding of Yorkshire County Council.\n",
      "Under an Act of Parliament in 1927, Alwoodley was incorporated into Leeds.\n",
      "The residents of Alwoodley, represented by Alwoodley Parish Council, had originally been opposed to incorporation into the expanding city.\n",
      "However, they were persuaded to agree to incorporation when the City of Leeds offered Alwoodley ratepayers a preferential rate for 15 years.\n",
      "Incorporation provided Alwoodley with modern utilities and services, such as water, gas, electricity, street lighting, sewerage and improved roads. \n",

A set of three late-C18 paddocks. The paddocks retain limestone boundary walls (fragmentary in places) along their north-west, north-east and south-west sides, but have lost their interior dividing walls and shelters.

The central section of the lane is sunk out of view of the hall in a cutting several metres deep with high coursed limestone walls that enabled the movement of coal without interrupting views or disturbing the family. The cutting incorporates a tunnel approximately 75 metres long known as the Dark Arch (see separate entry). A section of approach wall to the south-west of the Dark Arch on the north side incorporates a memorial headstone (perhaps to one of the wagonway’s horses) inscribed with the words ‘DOWNEY/ FAITHFUL HONEST/ MERRY TRUE/ WE LOVED YOU AND/ WE MOURNED YOU TOO/ 1856’. Approximately 327 metres to the north-east of the Dark Arch along the cutting is a late-C18 limestone bridge known as the Light Arch (see separate entry) that carries the south drive over Parlington Lane. The lane’s north-eastern section has views north and north-west to the north-east parkland, paddocks (also known as The Terraces  see separate entry), and the main avenue and Triumphal Arch. Due to the topography of the land the north-eastern section of Parlington Lane is raised above the neighbouring parkland and paddocks and has a high stone-revetted   Two mile long C18 wagonway and later railway, occasionally running in parallel   The lane was used as a horse- drawn wagonway in the C18 and early C19 to transport coal from the Gascoigne family’s collieries in Garforth to a coal staithe in Aberford on the Great North Road where it could be transported away. In 1837 the wagonway became part of the Aberford-Garforth Railway, which remained in use until 1924. The lane cuts straight through the hall’s grounds less than 200m south of the   bank on the north-west side with substantial slab copings.

      "text:   1.1 Background to the Neighbourhood Development Plan   In 2011, the government introduced legislation to enable communities to have a much greater say in how a community should change and develop over time.\n",
      "The Localism Act 2011, and the subsequent detailed Regulations in 2012, introduced the concept of Neighbourhood Planning.\n",
      "Through the Neighbourhood Development Plan (“the Plan”) it is possible to influence the amount, type and location of any new development, what facilities should be provided, and where.\n",
      "It also enables communities to influence design and materials to be used in any new development, to identify areas which should be protected (perhaps because of some historical, environmental or aesthetic reason) and areas which could or should be improved.   It is important to say that a Neighbourhood Development Plan is not a mechanism to resist or stop development: it is a Plan for shaping development.\n",
      "Without one, a community would have less control over what happens in the period covered by the Plan.\n",
      "But the Plan must be in ‘general conformity’ with the Local Plan as developed by Leeds City Council, as well as with national government policy as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework and Guidance.   The Plan is a statutory document that will, once adopted.\n",
      "be used to help determine planning applications in the parish.   1.2 Conforming with national and local policy   A key requirement of the Plan is that whilst it reflects local issues, concerns and priorities, it must be in general conformity with national policy and strategic local policy.\n",
      "There are two key policy documents that have needed to be taken account of to ensure this, described briefly below. \n",

      "text:   There are many theories as to the age and purpose of the earthworks.\n",
      "According to RIS (WYAAS) in 2000, the site appears quite clearly to be the remains of quarrying, and although some may superficially be of a defensive nature, they are definitely not Roman in character.\n",
      "The one caveat to dismissing the site as Roman is the fact that it appears on Warburton’s 1720 map of Yorkshire as a Roman station.\n",
      "Warburton is known to have stayed with the Leeds antiquarian Thoresby when he was surveying in this area and it is possible that he obtained information from Thoresby.\n",
      "Warburton has Pampocalia at the crossroads of two Roman roads (the east-west 729and a now unrecognised putative north-south road).\n",
      "The sharpness of the earthworks now on the site would not, probably, have appeared ancient in 1720 (even if they were that old).\n",
      "It may be that there were earthworks present at this date, and this area was subsequently subject to quarrying.\n",
      "There are certainly small quarries present in Hetchell Wood to the north.\n",
      "Its identification as a Roman site of whatever nature must be regarded as tentative and possibly dubious.   An alternative point of view is from historian Hazel Hill (nee Green), who was brought up in Scarcroft and undertook a field study of the site as part of a research project.\n",
      "Subsequent to the work she published a paper of her findings and in which further study is recommended.\n",
      "Below is an extract from her paper which makes interesting reading.   “The majority of the material of which the earthworks are constructed is of the reddish Permian basal sands.\n",
      "This reddish material can be observed in the lower levels of construction.\n",
      "On the summit of the western bank are cart load-sized mounds of a whiter limey material.\n",
      "This, I suggest, was a later addition of waste from the upper (eastern) Magnesium Limestone quarries.\n",
      "Ground level access for tipping was only from the north east corner.\n",
      "Here on the bridleway, traces of old tracks from the quarries converge.\n",
      "Tipping was on two arcs leaving an oval “arena” within.\n",
      "A central mound - at least at the southern end - was constructed as part of the original design.\n",
      "A low level entrance was built at the south west corner.\n",
      "The question is why, if this was just waste disposal; why wasn’t the area just completely filled in and levelled?\n",
      "I feel there must be some purpose for this design.   Pyramid tipping is clearly visible throughout the site.\n",
      "Each sloping layer of about one metre depth is overlain by another layer, but kept well back from the edge of the lower layer.\n",
      "This prevents slumping.\n",
      "The best view of this pyramid tipping can be seen from the top of the western arc at the southern end, looking down on to the entrance.   Since the original tipping - as shown by areas where pyramid tipping is visible - later additions have been made, material has been relocated, the central mound extended northwards and, most recently, (within the past hundred years), some material has been removed from the site.\n",
      "Worked flints of possibly Mesolithic and Neolithic type have been found in the Milner beck area, near Jubilee Bridge.\n",
      "Drawings of some of these were seen at the West Yorkshire Archive Service in Wakefield (WYAS).   A Roman altar has also been found near Milner Beck.\n",
      "Hazel Hill in researching the site did not find any flints there, but she did find two worked flints, close to the Roman road/bridleway, just east of Milner Lane.\n",
      "One is a small button scraper about a centimetre across, showing the curved marks of the bulb of percussion where it was struck, and it has been finely pressure worked on each side.\n",
      "The other is a triangular, broken, but skilfully worked flint, which was possibly an arrow head.\n",
      "They may be of Bronze Age origin.   Other items found on a field walk, in the plough soil, close to the bridleway, just NE of Milner Lane were a lump of iron slag, a piece of dark green glass cullet, part of an oyster shell, fossilised wood, a section of clay pipe, a lump of coarse red brick with inclusions and a piece of light coloured mediaeval pot.\n",
      "The first three items could have been of Roman origin, but the last three are of later date. \n",

The Character Area Assessment for the Conservation Area at Appendix 2 was undertaken throughout 2016 and incorporates much of the evidence base from the CAAMP and Village Design Statement.   The draft Neighbourhood Plan consultation document contained an objective to retain the historic character and heritage of Thorp Arch and a proposed policy to protect and maintain the Conservation Area status.\n",

      "text:   The built up area of the parish of Alwoodley is located in the north of Leeds.\n",
      "The 2001 and 2011 Census statistics indicate that population growth has remained largely static over the ten year period with an overall reduction of 311 people (from 9129 in 2001) and a slightly reduced number of households to 3666 in 2011.   Leeds City Council’s Site Allocation Plan has proposed building up to 285 units on a 13.43ha site in the parish of Alwoodley.\n",
      "The conclusions drawn from this report are that:    New development should provide for retirees and downsizers.\n",
      "This will enable existing larger homes to become available to people looking to move to family-sized accommodation whilst providing smaller homes for the older generation.    New development should provide for family homes to encourage new and existing families to move into Alwoodley.    New developments should seek to reflect local character, provide for a'village feel', not overwhelm surroundings i.e.\n",
      "be of similar scale and take note of character area assessments.    The proposed development site should have a site brief developed in order to inform the developer and planners.    Greenspace and access to the countryside should be well integrated in any new developments.   It is important to note that local needs have been identified through the consultation process, which focus on wanting to protect family homes from demolition to have flats built in their place and to protect bungalows from conversion to two storey homes.\n",
      "The continuing need for single storey accommodation in particular for older residents and the loss of these to create larger residences should be resisted if possible.   60 |\n",

      "text:   A NP is a community-led framework for guiding the future development and growth of a locality, such as a Parish, having defined boundaries and a qualifying authority such as a Parish Council.   At the outset of the process, the qualifying body, in our case Bardsey cum Rigton Parish Council, was required to define the area that the Plan will apply to and have that approved by Leeds City Council.\n",
      "For parished areas such as ours it is normal for the established Parish boundary to be the limits of this ‘Neighbourhood Area’, although that is not always the case.\n",
      "The Parish Council applied to the City Council for the whole of our Parish to be defined thus on 14th April 2012 and this decision was endorsed by Leeds City Council on 25th September 2012.\n",
      "Since that time, however, there has been a small but significant alteration in our Parish boundary with neighbouring Scarcroft and both Parish Councils requested that their Neighbourhood Area boundaries be brought into line with this change.\n",
      "The current Neighbourhood Area and Parish boundaries are illustrated in Map 1 overleaf.   There is considerable flexibility as to what is included in a NP.\n",
      "The principal objective is to define policies for the use and development of land, and to address the social, environmental and economic consequences of such development.\n",
      "Ideally the NP becomes a broader statement of the vision which a local community has for its own future.   It is equally important to understand what a NP is not.\n",
      "It cannot be used to impede proposed developments which have already gained planning consent.\n",
      "It should also fit into the Local Authority’s core strategy for development, not conflict with it.   The Neighbourhood Plan cannot be couched in terms designed to stop all development (indeed it should be in favour of appropriate development), but it can and should define the nature and extent of development ac- ceptable to, and required by, the local community.   Preparation of a Neighbourhood Plan requires adherence to certain procedures and basic conditions, including extensive public consultation.\n",
      "Before it can be made, the Neighbourhood Plan and its supporting material must meet the legislative requirements and pass examination by an Independent Examiner.\n",
      "Most importantly of all, it must then have been put before the community in a local referendum, and gain a share of the vote in excess of 50% of those who cast their vote.   Once made the Neighbourhood Plan gains legal status as part of the Leeds Local Development Plan and the Local Authority is under a statutory responsibility to afford full material weight to the Policies of the made Neighbourhood Plan when considering planning applications.   Bardsey Parish Council take the view that although the Neighbourhood Plan is intended to represent a longer term view of the development of the Village, circumstances may change.\n",
      "It has therefore decided to conduct a regular assessment of the Plan, and of progress towards the achievement of its objectives and projects, every 5 years. \n",

      "Indeed many of you will remember the Village Design Statement and the Parish Plan, which were published during the course of the last decade or so.\n",
      "Both sought to reflect the qualities of the Village, and to further the aspirations of its residents.\n",
      "Both have been instrumental in guiding Parish Council policy and funding.   This Neighbourhood Plan is a much more exciting and significant event, however.\n",
      "With the introduction of the Localism Act in 2011, we the residents have the opportunity to exert a much more profound influence over our own future.\n",
      "Yes the Neighbourhood Plan follows on from those earlier documents, but it is a very different entity.   Firstly it must achieve a democratic mandate to be adopted at all, established by a majority of residents voting in favour of it in a village referendum.\n",
      "Secondly, once adopted (and unlike earlier documents) it has statutory authority.\n",
      "It becomes part of the framework of legal regulation shaping many aspects of the development of Bardsey-cum-Rigton, and cannot be simply ignored or circumvented.\n",
      "These essential differences afford the community greatly increased input to key aspects such as housing development.   The Government’s intention is that the Neighbourhood Plan should be a key factor in Bardsey’s development for the next 15 years.\n",
      "As you will see it therefore includes policies covering a wide range of issues from healthy lifestyles to preserving the essential character of both the built and natural environments.\n",
      "Because of its relative importance and complexity, much of the work which has gone into its production has related to housing development, however.   Although at the time of submission Leeds City Council’s Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) is fortunately not seeking large scale housing development in Bardsey, our own Housing Needs Survey (HNS) identifies a clear need for some new housing in the Parish.\n",
      "The Neighbourhood Plan therefore includes strong planning policies designed to facilitate these smaller developments in appropriate locations, subject to the high design and quality standards desired by us all.   Finally I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to all our residents on behalf of Bardsey cum Rigton Parish Council, the Neighbourhood Plan Steering Committee and myself for your unfailing support and enormous contribution during the extended period over which our Neighbourhood Plan has been in preparation.\n",
      "We quite literally could not have delivered it without you.\n",
      "The reward is a Neighbourhood Plan which sets the course for our community for years to come, and will ensure the vitality and essential character of our very special Village is preserved for future generations. \n",

The decision to draw up such a Plan is optional, but not to do so would forego this unique opportunity for set- ting out our proposals for the growth of our community for the next 15 years.   Bardsey cum Rigton Parish Council therefore took the decision early in 2012 to draw up this Neighbourhood Plan.\n",

      "text:   Some years ago the Parish Council took the opportunity of drawing up a Village Design Statement and a Parish Plan, both useful documents that have helped shape the growth of our Parish since they were produced.\n",
      "How- ever, neither document holds the statutory importance of a Neighbourhood Plan.\n",
      "Since the announcement by Leeds City Council of the projected numbers of new homes required for the City over the next 15 years and the associated processes of identifying sites for these new homes, it has become clear to us and many other Par- ishes in the City that a NP is the only way for us to be actively engaged in planning how our community con- tributes to this growth plan.   But the Neighbourhood Plan does not stop there.\n",
      "Housing development is a key issue, but other equally im- portant aspects of Bardsey’s future are also included: for example a long term aspiration for Bardsey School, for health provision, for sport and leisure facilities, and for the natural environment – including our footpaths, bridleways, cycle ways, nature reserves, and green spaces.   The outcome of the City Council’s Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA)1 process has not removed the potential for ad hoc planning applications by developers.\n",
      "Without a NP in place the Village remains vulnerable to inappropriate development.\n",
      "With a NP in place, the wishes of the community will become part of the very process of planning in Bardsey cum Rigton.   1 SHLAA is a process undertaken by LCC to identify potential development sites by working with landowners and others who would like to propose land as available for housing development.\n",
      "Inclusion of a site in the SHLAA does not prejudice any future decision making with regard to a site being granted or refused planning permission. \n",

      "Property values reflect the village's desirable location for the executive market.\n",
      "Homelessness is not an immediate local problem, but premium property prices cause many young people to leave the village to find affordable housing.\n",
      "Unemployment All Hallows Church Hetchell Court is below the national and district averages, and most people work outside the Parish.\n",
      "However, there are a number of small businesses located within the Parish, for example building contractors, landscape gardeners, decorators and providers of financial services.\n",
      "The pub, hairdressers and three caravan parks also provide some jobs.\n",
      "Agriculture remains an important part of the Parish economy, but changing practices have resulted in much reduced levels of employment.\n",
      "An increasing number of residents are known to work mainly from home, taking advantage of modern technology.   The Anglican church of All Hallows, with its Saxon tower, is one of the oldest in the north of England and has a thriving congregation.\n",
      "Bardsey Primary School sits on two sites and is a ‘good’ school (OFSTED, February 2013) with 178 children on the school roll (2015).\n",
      "It serves the nearby village of East Keswick, as well as several other surrounding villages.\n",
      "The school has joined the Wharfe Valley Learning Partnership and is now a Trust School.\n",
      "This means that the school now holds its own Title Documents and the land belongs to the school within the Trust.\n",
      "The vision (aspiration) that the School Governors have held for many years is to rebuild a single site school which conforms to contemporary standards of access and amenity.\n",
      "Secondary education is not available in the Parish but is well provided for in the nearby towns of Wetherby and Boston Spa, as well as North Leeds.   The community is sufficiently large and varied to support many thriving voluntary groups together with a range of social, leisure and educational activities.\n",
      "These are mostly centred on the Village Hall and the Callister Hall located in the historic core of the village, adjacent to the tennis courts and crown bowling green.   The Sports Club, on Keswick Lane, adds to the range of facilities available to include well supported cricket and football teams.\n",
      "Next to the Sports Club is a well equipped children’s playground, and Park Field which is an ‘unstructured’ park area used by children and dog walkers.   Bardsey Sports Club   Notably absent from the Village are medical services; the nearest GP surgery and Pharmacy being in Collingham 2.5 miles distant, and the nearest Health Centre almost 5 miles away in Wetherby. \n",

      "The oldest buildings, including All Hallows’ Church, parts of which are of Saxon origin, and the Bingley Arms Public House dating from 953AD, are situated in the historic core of the village, designated as a Conservation Area.   The village developed with the creation of a road between Leeds and Wetherby in the early I820’s, later to become a turnpike and then a free highway, the forerunner of the A58.\n",
      "Following the arrival of the railway in   A58 North, from Mill Lane   1877, and later the growth in car ownership, people chose to live in rural surroundings and commute to Leeds, and the Village grew dramatically from the 1920’s onwards.\n",
      "Closed in 1964, much of the railway route remains undeveloped and may yet become part of the national cycle network.\n",
      "Today the busy A58, which runs through the Parish from north to south, and the A1M motorway, which passes 3 miles to the east, provide excellent road links north and south.   Bardsey is located on the bus routes from Leeds to Wetherby, providing access to public transport.\n",
      "One of these routes is a direct service along the A58, and the other routes via Bardsey Village (Keswick Lane), East Keswick and Collingham.\n",
      "Improving the frequency and accessibility of public transport links, thereby reducing dependency on cars, remains an aspiration.   There has been a primary school in the Village since 1726, originally located in the building which now serves the community as Callister Hall.\n",
      "It was replaced by a modern school in 1951 and is located on Woodacre Lane.   Unlike many villages, Bardsey is not one single tightly located community, but a series of loosely linked and geo- graphically separate settlements, each being of different character.\n",
      "This has some attractions, but it also provides a number of challenges which were recognized in the Village Design Statement of 2002 and the Parish Plan of 2003.   The six principal residential areas are identified by different colours on Map 2 opposite:  i) Village core: comprising Church Lane, Woodacre Lane & Crescent, the Cornmills, The Dell, Tithe Barn and Smithy     Lanes, and the Village Pond (blue).  ii) East side of A58: centered on East Rigton and including Rigton Bank, Mill Lane and Margaret Avenue (yellow).  iii) North: including Keswick Lane, the Drive, Woodacre Green and Grange Close (pink).  iv) North East: The Congreves, First Avenue, Second Avenue and Scarsdale Ridge (green).  v) South: The Waysides and isolated developments adjacent to Scarcroft Parish boundary (purple).  vi) South West: Blackmoor Lane, Spear Fir and the Ford area (orange).   \n",

To encourage proportionate housing development that is appropriate to the needs and wishes of residents in terms of location, volume, size and architectural design.   2. To maintain and improve the quality and character of the built environment.   3. To maintain and improve the sustainability, quality and biodiversity of the rural and historic environment.   4. To improve public highway safety and amenity for pedestrians and road users alike.   5. To identify and conserve those assets considered to be of significant community value, including green spaces and open views , across the Parish.\n",
      "Whereas it is rec- ognised that it is not within the gift of the Neighbourhood Plan to determine the status of green belt land, all stakeholders should note the strongly and repeatedly expressed views of the community in favour of preserving the green belt in and around the Parish.   6. To encourage appropriate and proportionate commercial activity, including home working.   7. To encourage healthy and active lifestyles, and strengthening the social fabric of the community, by developing and improving sport and leisure provision.   8. To improve pedestrian, equestrian and cycle access throughout the Parish by main- taining, extending and further connecting the network of footpaths and bridleways, to enhance and secure its position as an ideal location for walking, cycling and equestrian activities.

      "There are several types:-  Source control measures - deal with run-off at, or close to, the surface where rainfall lands.   Site control measures - manage the surface water run-off from larger areas, such as part of a housing estate, major roads or business parks. \n",
      "The run-off from larger areas can be channeled to a site control measure using swales (shallow drainage channels) or filter drains.   Regional control measures - downstream of source and site controls deal with the gathered run-off from a large area. \n",
      "These systems use the same principles as smaller scale SUDS, but can cope with larger volumes of water.   Rainwater that passes through small SUDS can feed into larger SUDS which deal with the gathered run-off from a wide area.\n",

Development proposals must be underpinned by a robust analysis of both the village of Walton of the immediate site context to inform the scale, massing, form, materials and details of any proposal  2. Development proposals should consider the importance of St Peters church to the village, including opportunities to protect and enhance its setting and impact on the local skyline  3. Small grass verges and landscaping to the edges of the highway are a particular feature throughout Walton and these features should be incorporated wherever possible  4. Wherever possible, the orientation of buildings should front the main highway, as characterised throughout Walton  5. Variation of the building line to the street will assist in mirroring the character of Walton where existing dwellings have a range of setbacks, from buildings which meet ‘back of footpath’ through to dwellings with generous front gardens with mature landscaping  6. Vertical articulation of dwellings and their façades should be dealt with sensitively.\n",
      "Many dwellings in the village benefit from chimneys which add definition to roof lines and also pitched canopies to entrance ways offer articulation to the front façade, joining the ground and first stories;  7. Landscape treatments within front gardens are a strong visual feature of streets within Walton, and a landscape plan for a development of any size should be considered from the outset, with plants, shrubs and trees provided with space to mature within the built form layout;     This document has been produced by Walton Parish Council on behalf of the community, with the help of the Leeds City Council Neighbourhood Planning Team.\n",

      "text:   The Localism Act of 2011 gave Barwick in Elmet and Scholes Parish Council the impetus to commission a Neighbourhood Plan to ensure the sustainable development of the Parish, its villages, farmland and countryside.   The Neighbourhood Plan, once adopted, will become a statutory planning document included in Leeds Local Plan and Core Strategy, will conform to the National Planning Policy Framework, and will be considered in conjunction with any planning application.   2011 Open meetings, to which all residents were invited were held in December 2011 and January 2012 and the potential for development and the possibility of a Neighbourhood Plan explained.   From these meetings residents were enthusiastic to contribute and a considerable number of these residents provided information and evidence for the Plan.   Progress has been slow as the two main villages are very different and do not have the same needs but gradually a unified Plan has appeared.\n",
      "There have been numerous questionnaires circulated to all residents, drop in sessions and consultations.\n",
      "The response from residents has been tremendous.   A successful financial application for assistance from Locality (Planning Aid) led to employment of a planning consultant to advise on the preparation of the plan, another to provide a ‘Housing Needs Survey’ and hours of free assistance from a further consultant.   A second grant enabled the work to reach a conclusion.\n",
      "Leeds City Council has provided guidance through the long process.   The group working on the plan for the whole five years is small and their dedication and hard work is appreciated.   2016   Residents, this is your plan.\n",
      "Please, take the time to read it.\n",
      "The Parish Council and the Neighbourhood Planning Team recommend it to you. \n",

      "These need to be laid out and landscaped to achieve their full potential (see p77 and sketch below).\n",
      "No single development is likely to be able to achieve this and it will rely on alternative funding, possibly through local allocation of CIL contributions.   • Some improvements to Holbeck Moor have been made, but there are other areas which could also be enhanced with additional play facilities, litter bins and landscaping.\n",
      "Lighting requires improvement particularly on Holbeck Moor and in the underpasses.   Street furniture   • Many Holbeck residents (81% of those who expressed a view) felt Holbeck should have its own ‘look’ for signs, benches, bins and interpretation boards, to provide uniformity and an identity for street furniture within the public realm.\n",
      "A coherent design style for street furniture - signage, interpretation boards, public seating and litter bins – will help to contribute to a distinctive identity for Holbeck.   Vacant sites   • Vacant sites (see Policy E4).\n",

      "text:   The Neighbourhood Area enjoys a rich and varied historic environment, from the brutalist architecture of Scholes’ St Philip’s Church, through to the iron age fortifications along Becca Bank.\n",
      "The lost medieval village at Potterton is another notable reminder of the many centuries of history of the Neighbourhood Area.   It is certain that the character of Barwick in Elmet and Scholes is strongly shaped by its history and heritage and that this is highly valued by residents and visitors alike.\n",
      "A living example of how the community cherishes its heritage is the celebrations which take place around the Maypole in Barwick in Elmet which draws visitors from far and wide.   Both Scholes and Barwick in Elmet have historic cores to the villages designated as Conservation Areas containing perhaps the best of the parish’s built heritage.\n",
      "However, the parish is blessed with a rich built heritage across the whole of the area, including isolated farm and estate houses on the Parlington and Bramham estates.\n",
      "The latter estates provide strong reminders of past wealth.   In planning for any new development, the particular features of village character areas and the countryside beyond need to be taken into account, for example in the use of building materials and in the design of the existing building stock, particularly that which forms the historical core of the settlements.\n",
      "This applies equally to new build as to renovations, conversions and any alterations covered by permitted development.   In Barwick in Elmet and Potterton, the dominant building materials are magnesian limestone with blue (welsh) slate roofing: for Scholes, red brick is more reflective of the heritage of the place but limestone is also evident, again with blue slate the dominant roofing material.\n",
      "Of course, variations to this vernacular exist with red pantile roofing in particular appearing outside Conservation Areas.   The Conservation Areas in both main villages are very well maintained and provide strong indicators for how future development should take place, with many distinctive features detailed in the Conservation Area Appraisals and Management Plans and reflected on further in the draft Village Design Statement.\n",
      "Potterton, although too small for a Conservation Area itself, is well maintained and is distinct in the Neighbourhood Area, although not in the City, as a ‘dark’ village that is without street lighting.   Consultations revealed strong support for limiting urban sprawl into the surrounding open countryside, maintaining the open nature of the Neighbourhood Area.\n",
      "In addition, consultation for the first draft of this NP revealed strong support for this policy with 93% of respondents supporting proposals to maintain and improve the quality of the built environment through design policy 47Barwick in Elmet and Scholes Neighbourhood Plan 2016 \n",

      "text:   In May 2012 the Parish Council organised a village Community Conference in Bramham Village Hall.\n",
      "At the Conference the NPSG set up displays explaining what a Neighbourhood Plan is about and gathered comments and ideas from residents attending, all of which provided the first input to the content of this Plan.   In Autumn 2012 we issued information and a questionnaire on Leeds City Council’s (LCC) proposed Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) sites asking for comments.\n",
      "Then in 2013 LCC added a further, very large, proposed site on Green Belt land at Headley Hall to the SHLAA.\n",
      "The NPSG issued a further questionnaire and held drop in sessions in the village hall to again give information to residents and gather views.\n",
      "The majority of responses indicated firm opposition to the proposed large site and work within the NPSG therefore became focused on opposing it rather than developing the Neighbourhood Plan.\n",
      "Then, in Autumn 2015, University of Leeds, owners of the land at Headley, withdrew the site and the NPSG resumed work on the Neighbourhood Plan, using all of the views and information gathered to inform the Neighbourhood Plan questionnaire, which was issued in September 2016, and the Plan itself.   In addition to the engagement outlined above with the initial Community Conference, and questionnaires and drop in sessions on the SHLAA sites, we have throughout kept residents involved and informed through the monthly Parish magazine, and through our Neighbourhood Plan and Parish Council websites.\n",
      "At conferences and drop in sessions, members of the group have been there to engage personally with residents.\n",
      "We have also stressed throughout that new members are welcome and needed, and are pleased to have had new members joining.   On the wider spectrum of engagement, we encouraged residents to engage with Leeds City Council by advising them how take part in the SHLAA consultation and encouraging them to do so.\n",
      "We kept them advised of progress and developments within LCC as well as within our own group.   At every stage of consultation residents’ responses were retained and analysed, providing the basis for our vision and for the Neighbourhood Plan questionnaire, which was issued by volunteers to each of the 760 approx.\n",
      "households in Bramham, during the summer of 2016.\n",
      "Completed questionnaires could be returned by Freepost, and also by handing in at our Village Shop, a focal point in Bramham.\n",
      "We were delighted that over 40% of households returned their completed questionnaires.\n",
      "A summary of the responses is shown in the Consultation Statement Community Survey 2016.   A consultation event was held to discuss the draft vision, themes, objectives and policies in the Village Hall on 4th February 2017.\n",
      "32 people attended the event which resulted in a number of useful discussions and comments.\n",
      "These comments were analysed by the steering group and were incorporated into the Plan where appropriate.   A business survey was conducted and a questionnaire was delivered to businesses within the parish in June 2017.\n",
      "47 questionnaires were posted to local businesses whilst another 36 were made available at Bowcliffe Hall.\n",
      "The responses were analysed and are the results are shown in the Consultation Statement Bramham NDP Business Survey 2017.   In August 2017, the NPSG opened a conversation with University of Leeds with the aim of consulting on its future plans for the land that it owns in the south of the parish, that is currently used for agricultural research and education.   This continued engagement and ensuing responses have ensured that our Neighbourhood Plan has been developed using the views of local residents and local businesses at every step.\n",
      "This, and our use of Bramham’s well used community facilities and hubs, such as the Parish magazine, websites, the Village Hall and the Village Shop have resulted in a Neighbourhood Plan that is a true community product. \n",

      "text:   In Medieval times the influence of the church in the form of Nostel Priory which had land around the village granted to it in 1126 was a big influence on the area.\n",
      "During the War of the Roses some of the dead from the Battle of Towton (1461) may have been buried in a communal grave in the churchyard.\n",
      "Again, in the English Civil War the victims of the fighting at the Battle of Marston Moor (1644) are recorded as having been buried in the churchyard.   The area has always been agricultural, however throughout its history the Parish has been quarried for its limestone which was used in the construction of Roman York and has continued to be exploited ever since.\n",
      "More recently, the village’s position on the Great North Road (A1) has shaped its development.\n",
      "By the seventeenth century Bramham had established itself as an important staging post for travellers and had many coaching inns.\n",
      "The village was at its peak in the nineteenth century when further development may have been constrained by the presence of major landowners in the area such as Bramham Park which is now home amongst other things to internationally famous events such as the Bramham Horse Trials and the Leeds Festival.   In the first half of the 20th century Bramham also played its part in the two World Wars.\n",
      "During the First World War an airfield opened at Headley at which a squadron of the RFC/RAF was based.\n",
      "During the Second World War dummy aircraft were placed on the airfield to mislead the enemy into thinking that the base was still active.\n",
      "There can still be found one of the aircraft hangars now a listed building.\n",
      "Also during the Second World War Bramham Park was home to a Prisoner of War camp for Italian prisoners.\n",
      "The War Memorial in the village square bears witness to the human cost to the parish.   The Great North Road continued to pass through the village until 1960 when the first bypass was built.\n",
      "This had the effect of giving the village back some of its rural character.\n",
      "However, the lack of passing trade meant the decline of local shops.   Today, Bramham is a modern village within the metropolitan district of Leeds and has a very active and lively community.\n",
      "This is well demonstrated by the existence of a wide range of committees, clubs and groups, organising events and activities for people of all ages, as well as maintaining important facilities and services that benefit residents.   The village retains very close ties with the Lane Fox family (descendants of Robert Benson, first Lord Bingley), owners of the nearby Bramham Park estate.\n",
      "Bramham Park is not only home to a fine, Baroque country house and splendid gardens, both open to the public during the summer months, but also known for hosting an international four day equestrian event (Bramham Horse Trials), and more recently as the site of the Leeds Festival.\n",
      "Currently, residents of Bramham are given free tickets for the latter in return for making a small financial contribution to the Bramham Community Fund.   Leeds City Council’s adopted Core Strategy identified Bramham as a smaller settlement.\n",
      "Smaller settlements are defined as communities which have a population of at least 1500, a primary school, and a shop or pub.   According to the 2011 Census, the parish of Bramham had a population of 1650, of which 99% were from a white ethnic group.\n",
      "Of the 718 households, 534 households had access to one or two cars or vans and 86 households had access to at least three cars or vans.\n",
      "98 households did not have access to a car or van.\n",
      "The Census showed that 18% of the population were between the ages of 0-17, 6% were between the ages of 18-24, 10% between the ages of 25-34, 16% between the ages of 35-44, 25% between the ages of 45-59, 14% between the ages of 60-69 and 11% were 70 and over.   University of Leeds owns Headley Hall.\n",
      "It forms part of the University’s Field Research Unit and is used as the main arable centre.\n",
      "A considerable amount of ecological and agronomic work is carried out at the farms including crop tests, field trials of GM crops, small mammals (including radio-tracking), beneficial insects, trees and crops, intercropping and farm animal nutrition1. \n",

      "text:   25BRAMHAM NEIGHBOURHOOD DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2018-2033   The Leeds Landscape Assessment 1994 describes the areas surrounding Leeds as follows: the ancient townships of the Leeds area were largely established by the late 10th century, when the township comprised a population and its associated exploitable territory, which commonly included unenclosed arable lands, pasture, meadow, woodland, common and waste.\n",
      "Over this landscape of villages and fields were superimposed two additional administrative systems.   These were firstly an ecclesiastical system of parishes, usually coincident with one or more townships, with a church at the parish centre and secondly a manorial organisation which was not always so directly related to the township framework.\n",
      "The parish structure was largely in place in the Leeds area by the 11th century and remained relatively unchanged until the urban growth of the industrial period.   The ownership of land and the attendant manorial framework, however, were subject to continual change.\n",
      "This changing pattern of ownership and tenurial organisation through the Middle Ages and later, led amongst other things, to the unusually large number of 17th-18th century park estates, which still survive in the belt from Harewood in the north, through Bramham and Parlington, round to the south-east side of the District at Ledston and Temple Newsam.\n",
      "Today, features such as manor houses, moated buildings, gardens, castles, mills, fishponds and deer parks still survive from this time.\n",
      "Local buildings in Bramham were historically built with Magnesian Limestone, although more recently, brick and other materials are used.   In 2010 study by Natural England3 looked at green infrastructure corridors for Yorkshire and the Humber.\n",
      "It determined that much of the area surrounding Bramham village, (although not the village itself), including Bramham Park, was designated by S19 Limestone Ridge (see map 4: Green Infrastructure Corridor Map4 ). The Limestone Ridge is a subregional corridor which runs from the south of Doncaster to Wetherby.\n",
      "Most of the corridor is rural and it is characterised by large blocks of woodland and rolling farmland bounded by hedges and distinctive limestone buildings.\n",
      "There are also a number of parkland estates including Bramham and, as such, the area has both landscape and historical importance.   Bramham is located within the Magnesian Limestone Belt and is further characterised by gently rolling fields of arable which are bordered by low gappy hedgerows and isolated hedgerow trees, with small pockets of intact pasture occurring around the village fringes.\n",
      "It is surrounded by open arable farmland which typically occurs in the lower lying and gently rolling eastern pans of the district, including east Bramham.\n",
      "The openness of the farmland and lack of woodland allows for long uninterrupted views.   Bramham Moor was unenclosed until the nineteenth century but is now enclosed and cultivated, forming a productive area of large regular fields, interrupted by occasional woodland and patches of pasture.   Map 4: Green infrastructure corridors (Natural England)   The main watercourses that run directly through Bramham are Carr Beck and Bramham Beck.\n",

      "Compared to these larger geographies the key differences are:  • over the decade between the 2001 and 2011 censuses the parish population has declined even though the number of households increased, due to decreasing average household size;  • there are fewer young children and young adults;  • there are considerably more people over the age of 65;  • people that are economically active are more likely to be in higher and medium level occupations; and people are healthier and are less likely to have limitations in their day to day activities even though there is a high proportion of older residents in the parish.     4. There are significant trends within in the population:  • a declining number of young people resident in the parish; and  • a growing number of older people resident in the parish.     5. The housing stock:  • has a very high proportion of detached houses and bungalows with a very low proportion of terraced homes, flats and apartments;  • has a high proportion (over 75%) of homes that have 3 bedrooms or more;  • generates a low supply of re-sales and re-lets as households tend to stay resident in the parish long term;  • generates high demand, driven by easy access to labour markets by road, a high quality environment and good schools.\n",
      "The parish is described by stakeholders as ‘a place to move up to’.  • is consequently more expensive than average prices for Leeds and the region  • is unlikely to be affordable to households on average income unless they can find significant deposits; and  • is unlikely to be affordable to first time buyers.     6. There is little supply of social or affordable housing in the parish.\n",
      "Although many households on the waiting list for social housing aspire to live in the parish, limited supply from relets means that there is only a small amount of active demand. \n",

The key finding of our review are that:  • the parish local housing market sits within the outer north east quadrant of the City of Leeds;  • the population of Leeds grew by about 5% in the decade 2001-2011; due mainly to an excess of births over deaths in the city however there is a net outflow of people from Leeds to other local authority areas;  • the number of households is rising at a slightly faster rate than the population due to the diminishing average size of households across the city.\n",
      "This is smaller than the rate of change for England;  • new housebuilding completions are running at over 2,000 homes per annum across the City and this number of completion is expected to rise;  • the volume of sales of re-sale and new build housing dropped dramatically after 2008 and is only recently showing signs of recovery.\n",

      "text:   The Battle of Bramham Moor took place on Monday 19th February 1408.\n",
      "It was the final battle in the Percy Rebellion of 1402 – 1408 and was between Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland and King Henry IV.\n",
      "The battle ranged over the area bounded by Camp Hill, Headley Hall and Oglethorpe Hills (the highest point of the Moor), either side of the road to Toulston5.     Memorial board    Percy Cross    In February, in heavy snow, Percy’s army marched towards York. Sir Thomas Rokeby, High Sheriff of Yorkshire, heard of Percy’s approach and raised his own army, and blocked the bridge at Knaresborough. Percy’s army advanced through Boroughbridge and Wetherby, and was being pursued by the King’s men, so he went on to Tadcaster, until he stopped and positioned his men on Bramham Moor to await the arrival of Rokeby and his men. The battle started at 2pm, and although it was short, it was said to be furious and bloody. It is generally believed that Rokeby led the charge against Percy and began a violent spree of hand-to-hand combat. Percy’s army was rapidly defeated with Lord Bardolph being fatally wounded and Percy himself lost his life, either by being killed in action or captured and then quickly executed.    The spot where Percy fell was subsequently marked by a memorial stone cross, which was removed to a wood on the edge of the battlefield as it interfered with the farmers’ cultivation of the land.    Moves are afoot to move the cross into the village  where it will better protected and appreciated by  villagers and visitors to the battlefield.    5http://historicbramham.org.uk/battle-of-bramham-moor3.html    Our survey showed that 82% (245 people) wanted the battle of Bramham Moor site and memorial stone to be protected. This Plan therefore identifies the Bramham Moor Battlefield, as specified on map 8, as a valued landscape area. This identification is the equivalent of that covered by the previous policy    H1 for non-designated local heritage assets and has been informed by the same criteria published by Historic England in their Local Heritage Listing Advice Note 7 (May 2016). However, there are key differences in the nature of the site compared to other proposed local heritage assets, and the Steering Group decided to create a separate policy for the Battlefield, recognising:    The extensive nature of the battlefield. The lack of certainty of its precise boundaries i.e. where the battle started or finished.     The essential nature of the land which is almost entirely agricultural with few physical features that distinguish it as an heritage asset from other parts of the adjoining countryside.   In summary, the area covered is recognised for the importance of the historic events that took place there, not for any remaining physical features.   In that non-designated heritage assets are identified by the local planning authority, the Parish Council will nominate the Battlefield and provide the supporting evidence to the City Council for inclusion in the Schedule of non-designated heritage assets maintained by the Council as part of the AMR.   Policy H2 provides protection for the integrity and historic interpretation of the Battlefield as a valued landscape area.   33BRAMHAM NEIGHBOURHOOD DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2018-2033 \n",

      "text:         a) Respect the surrounding and adjacent built form.     To support the continuing use of the University of Leeds Estate for agricultural/research/ academic purposes and other developments which comply with Policy UoL.1  There are three main areas of built development at the site as illustrated in the site plan (Map 16: University of Leeds site map): • Wise Warren Farm - the farm comprises an occupied house and a series of outbuildings that are predominantly unused (see map 16).        Bramham has a unique character that must be preserved and enhanced wherever possible. This does not mean that new ideas and materials should be dismissed but these need to be considered alongside high levels of design to ensure that the unique character of Bramham is never lost. Any alterations, extensions or additions to the built environment need to be carefully considered in order for them to help maintain and enhance the overall appeal of the parish.   b) Reflect local building design, form and style.\n",
      "c) Where possible, reflect the best design within those parts of the Conservation Area, adjacent to the proposed development.\n",
      "d) Take full account of heritage buildings and other assets.\n",
      "e) Encourage innovative building design where appropriate.   c) Where possible, reflect the best design within those parts of the Conservation Area, adjacent to the proposed development. d) Take full account of heritage buildings and other assets. e) Encourage innovative building design where appropriate.    Outside the Conservation Area, there are the areas of housing on the north side of the village together with small pockets of housing elsewhere. The original council estate is a great asset to the village with solidly built houses. Their unique character with spacious gardens especially onto Clifford Road need to be retained. Similarly, the newer estates within the parish have a character of their own. Although they are not unique in their design and similar examples can be found throughout the country they add to diversity of the area.   f) To be supported development proposals must demonstrate they will not result in additional on-street parking of vehicles.   f) To be supported development proposals must demonstrate they will not result in additional on-street parking of vehicles.    The principles of design and detailing of all structures within the Conservation Area should be extended to the remainder of the parish in order that the unique nature of the village is never lost nor dwarfed by buildings of a different nature surrounding the conservation area. In particular, the small hamlet around Headley Hall is quite unique and care should be taken to ensure that it does not lose its appeal owing to its existing character. The parish is a small community in rural surroundings but the existing small spaces within the actual village are vital to the overall appearance and character that we aim to retain and enhance. The spaces are of equal importance to the actual buildings and it is not only the actual spaces enclosed by the buildings but the views that are to be seen between these structures. Over recent years, many spaces have been lost, gardens have been built on and many views blocked. This has had a detrimental effect on the appearance of the village and care must be taken to ensure that the overall character is not destroyed. It is essential that spaces between buildings are given a high priority when consideration is given to any planning application for extensions and in fills. It is not merely the buildings that make the village unique it is the roads, footpaths, courts and spaces between structures that add to the character and well-being of the parish.    The design and detailing of all external spaces are as important as the design of actual buildings that surround them, (including car parking spaces). The character of the area can be greatly enhanced by the detailing of street furniture and materials. The street scene is very important. Care needs to be taken to retain areas of paving and setts and not replacing them with tarmac. The existing stone walls around the parish need to be protected and kept in good order as they add to the character of the parish. Of specific importance are the walls bounding Aberford Road, Windmill Hill and Bowcliffe Road.

These views should be protected.    2. From village square, south towards Almshouse Hill    aim to protect view of traditional village buildings dating from the village’s early history and the war memorial.    The CAAMP notes the importance of key views as follows: “Despite the gradient of Town Hill, Bramham village effectively nestles in a distinct hollow and is therefore not highly visible within the wider landscape, though good views into the village are possible from the outer edges of the settlement. From within the village itself Town Hill and Almshouse Hill offer commanding views of the houses around the historic core, and views out of the village toward the surrounding agricultural and park land are always important.”    3. From the Jubilee Gardens, south towards village centre – aim to protect view of traditional dwellings leading to village square.    4. From cattle ramp towards the Red Lion public house – aim to protect view of historic cattle ramp, Carr Beck, public house, and square.    5. From village square towards Senior Citizens’ Centre and garden – aim to protect view of traditional building and green space in the heart of the village facing the square.    6. From Lyndon Road incorporating green space and then north towards Clifford – aim to protect view of green space on Lyndon Road and rural aspect to north of village.    In addition, the Core Strategy Policy P10: Design, states that development will protect and enhance locally important buildings, spaces, skylines and views. There are eight key short range views and nine key long range views in to and out of Bramham. These are illustrated in map 13 and map 14 and noted as follows: 7. From the junction of Aberford Road and Freely Lane looking north up Freely Lane – aim to protect view of Historic building (Bramham Lodge) and playing field opposite.    8. From Almshouse Hill looking north over the village    aim to protect view of panorama over village centre.    Short range views:    1. From New Road, east towards All Saints’ Church – aim to protect view of historic church and churchyard.    Long range views:    1. From Aberford Road south east down Headley Lane – aim to protect view of open countryside and agricultural land in south of Bramham parish. 5. South along Windmill Road, looking uphill towards the Windmill – aim to protect open countryside with view of the historic windmill.    6. Oglethorpe Hills towards Oglethorpe Hall Farm – aim to protect open countryside on eastern edge of village giving view of historic farmhouse.    2. From the junction of Paradise Way and Bowcliffe Road towards Bramham village centre – aim to preserve rural entrance to Bramham. 3. From the cycle path running parallel to, and east of, the A1, south east towards the village – aim to protect the immediate environment of the village and conservation area. 7. Warren Lane south from the Quarry entrance – aim to protect view to Headley settlement showing its rural position.    8. From the cycle path running parallel to, and east of, the A1, east towards lynchets (medieval terraces) on hillside – aim to protect view of historic landscape.    4. From junction of Thorner Road and Paradise Way towards All Saints’ Church – aim to protect the village panorama and skyline. 9.

Policies summarised    UoL1: University of Leeds Estate    Objectives addressed    The University of Leeds have owned or leased the majority of the land identified on the site location plan (Map 15 University of Leeds estate boundary) since around the 1940s. The site was originally predominantly used for teaching and research on arable, dairy and pig production.    In the 1990s, the University leased much of the land to a wholly owned subsidiary company called the University of Leeds Farms Ltd. However, since this point the use of the farms for teaching has broadly declined. Many of the current buildings within the site are vacant and in need of repair, e.g. Wise Warren Farm.    13% (39 respondents) answered, I am against all forms of development associated with renewable energy within Bramham Parish.    49% (145 respondents) answered, yes, providing it is small scale and out of sight.    The University are currently in the process of dissolving the University of Leeds Farms Ltd and developing a new estate strategy. The intention is to dissolve the limited company with a view to managing the estate within the Facilities Directorate under a new structure. The research activities will bring some buildings on the three existing farms back into use where possible. However, it is likely that some vacant buildings will need to be converted to other viable uses (eg residential). There is the potential to convert the existing agricultural barns at Wise Warren Farm to dwellings.    The University consider there is potential to develop   renewable energy solutions on the estate (eg a solar farm) and these could be linked to the existing expansion of research activity at Spen Farm.   farm) and these could be linked to the existing  expansion of research activity at Spen Farm.    • Headley Hall Farm – the site comprises of a collection of disused farm buildings. It is at this location that a previous housing scheme was approved in February 2009 (see map 16).    • Spen Farm - the farm is currently used as a research facility including a pig research unit (see map 16).    31% (91 respondents) answered,   yes, no problems with any small development including visible small scale turbines, solar panels, etc.   development including visible small  scale turbines, solar panels, etc.    7% (21 respondents) answered,   yes, completely supportive of any developments associated with renewable energy.   developments associated with  renewable energy.   \n",

      "However because of the limited diversity in the housing stock (chapter 2) plus choices made by aging households to downsize and mitigate health issues, there was a mismatch between the likely supply of housing and the requirement of households seeking to move.   5.44 The mismatch occurs in terms of house size, type, tenure and special features.   5.45 We estimate that 18 additional dwellings over 5 years are needed to meet this need:  • 11 dwellings of specified size type and tenure; and  • a further 7 dwellings that address mobility and support needs.     5.46 Part C of the survey sought information from households that had moved into the parish in the last 5 years.\n",
      "Reasons for moving to the parish were to be closer to family, to upsize, to downsize, for village life, employment and relationship breakdown.   5.47 10 households moved within the parish, 11 households moved from nearby towns, 15 from other parts of Leeds and 4 were long distance re-locations. \n",

      "text:   In May 2012 the Parish Council organised a village Community Conference in Bramham Village Hall.\n",
      "At the Conference the NPSG set up displays explaining what a Neighbourhood Plan is about and gathered comments and ideas from residents attending, all of which provided the first input to the content of this Plan.   In Autumn 2012 we issued information and a questionnaire on Leeds City Council’s (LCC) proposed Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) sites asking for comments.\n",
      "Then in 2013 LCC added a further, very large, proposed site on Green Belt land at Headley Hall to the SHLAA.\n",
      "The NPSG issued a further questionnaire and held drop in sessions in the village hall to again give information to residents and gather views.\n",
      "The majority of responses indicated firm opposition to the proposed large site and work within the NPSG therefore became focused on opposing it rather than developing the Neighbourhood Plan.\n",
      "Then, in Autumn 2015, University of Leeds, owners of the land at Headley, withdrew the site and the NPSG resumed work on the Neighbourhood Plan, using all of the views and information gathered to inform the Neighbourhood Plan questionnaire, which was issued in September 2016, and the Plan itself.   In addition to the engagement outlined above with the initial Community Conference, and questionnaires and drop in sessions on the SHLAA sites, we have throughout kept residents involved and informed through the monthly Parish magazine, and through our Neighbourhood Plan and Parish Council websites.\n",
      "At conferences and drop in sessions, members of the group have been there to engage personally with residents.\n",
      "We have also stressed throughout that new members are welcome and needed, and are pleased to have had new members joining.   On the wider spectrum of engagement, we encouraged residents to engage with Leeds City Council by advising them how take part in the SHLAA consultation and encouraging them to do so.\n",
      "We kept them advised of progress and developments within LCC as well as within our own group.   At every stage of consultation residents’ responses were retained and analysed, providing the basis for our vision and for the Neighbourhood Plan questionnaire, which was issued by volunteers to each of the 760 approx.\n",

      "Completed questionnaires could be returned by Freepost, and also by handing in at our Village Shop, a focal point in Bramham.\n",
      "We were delighted that over 40% of households returned their completed questionnaires.\n",
      "A summary of the responses is shown in the Consultation Statement Community Survey 2016.   A consultation event was held to discuss the draft vision, themes, objectives and policies in the Village Hall on 4th February 2017.\n",
      "32 people attended the event which resulted in a number of useful discussions and comments.\n",
      "These comments were analysed by the steering group and were incorporated into the Plan where appropriate.   A business survey was conducted and a questionnaire was delivered to businesses within the parish in June 2017.\n",
      "47 questionnaires were posted to local businesses whilst another 36 were made available at Bowcliffe Hall.\n",
      "The responses were analysed and are the results are shown in the Consultation Statement Bramham NDP Business Survey 2017.   In August 2017, the NPSG opened a conversation with University of Leeds with the aim of consulting on its future plans for the land that it owns in the south of the parish, that is currently used for agricultural research and education.   This continued engagement and ensuing responses have ensured that our Neighbourhood Plan has been developed using the views of local residents and local businesses at every step.\n",
      "This, and our use of Bramham’s well used community facilities and hubs, such as the Parish magazine, websites, the Village Hall and the Village Shop have resulted in a Neighbourhood Plan that is a true community product. \n",

      "text:   In Medieval times the influence of the church in the form of Nostel Priory which had land around the village granted to it in 1126 was a big influence on the area.\n",
      "During the War of the Roses some of the dead from the Battle of Towton (1461) may have been buried in a communal grave in the churchyard.\n",
      "Again, in the English Civil War the victims of the fighting at the Battle of Marston Moor (1644) are recorded as having been buried in the churchyard.   The area has always been agricultural, however throughout its history the Parish has been quarried for its limestone which was used in the construction of Roman York and has continued to be exploited ever since.\n",
      "More recently, the village’s position on the Great North Road (A1) has shaped its development.\n",
      "By the seventeenth century Bramham had established itself as an important staging post for travellers and had many coaching inns.\n",
      "The village was at its peak in the nineteenth century when further development may have been constrained by the presence of major landowners in the area such as Bramham Park which is now home amongst other things to internationally famous events such as the Bramham Horse Trials and the Leeds Festival.   In the first half of the 20th century Bramham also played its part in the two World Wars.\n",
      "During the First World War an airfield opened at Headley at which a squadron of the RFC/RAF was based.\n",
      "During the Second World War dummy aircraft were placed on the airfield to mislead the enemy into thinking that the base was still active.\n",
      "There can still be found one of the aircraft hangars now a listed building.\n",
      "Also during the Second World War Bramham Park was home to a Prisoner of War camp for Italian prisoners.\n",
      "The War Memorial in the village square bears witness to the human cost to the parish.   The Great North Road continued to pass through the village until 1960 when the first bypass was built.\n",
      "This had the effect of giving the village back some of its rural character.\n",
      "However, the lack of passing trade meant the decline of local shops.   Today, Bramham is a modern village within the metropolitan district of Leeds and has a very active and lively community.\n",
      "This is well demonstrated by the existence of a wide range of committees, clubs and groups, organising events and activities for people of all ages, as well as maintaining important facilities and services that benefit residents.   The village retains very close ties with the Lane Fox family (descendants of Robert Benson, first Lord Bingley), owners of the nearby Bramham Park estate.\n",
      "Bramham Park is not only home to a fine, Baroque country house and splendid gardens, both open to the public during the summer months, but also known for hosting an international four day equestrian event (Bramham Horse Trials), and more recently as the site of the Leeds Festival.\n",
      "Currently, residents of Bramham are given free tickets for the latter in return for making a small financial contribution to the Bramham Community Fund.   Leeds City Council’s adopted Core Strategy identified Bramham as a smaller settlement.\n",
      "Smaller settlements are defined as communities which have a population of at least 1500, a primary school, and a shop or pub.   According to the 2011 Census, the parish of Bramham had a population of 1650, of which 99% were from a white ethnic group.\n",
      "Of the 718 households, 534 households had access to one or two cars or vans and 86 households had access to at least three cars or vans.\n",
      "98 households did not have access to a car or van.\n",
      "The Census showed that 18% of the population were between the ages of 0-17, 6% were between the ages of 18-24, 10% between the ages of 25-34, 16% between the ages of 35-44, 25% between the ages of 45-59, 14% between the ages of 60-69 and 11% were 70 and over.   University of Leeds owns Headley Hall.\n",
      "It forms part of the University’s Field Research Unit and is used as the main arable centre.\n",

      "text:   25BRAMHAM NEIGHBOURHOOD DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2018-2033   The Leeds Landscape Assessment 1994 describes the areas surrounding Leeds as follows: the ancient townships of the Leeds area were largely established by the late 10th century, when the township comprised a population and its associated exploitable territory, which commonly included unenclosed arable lands, pasture, meadow, woodland, common and waste.\n",
      "Over this landscape of villages and fields were superimposed two additional administrative systems.   These were firstly an ecclesiastical system of parishes, usually coincident with one or more townships, with a church at the parish centre and secondly a manorial organisation which was not always so directly related to the township framework.\n",
      "The parish structure was largely in place in the Leeds area by the 11th century and remained relatively unchanged until the urban growth of the industrial period.   The ownership of land and the attendant manorial framework, however, were subject to continual change.\n",
      "This changing pattern of ownership and tenurial organisation through the Middle Ages and later, led amongst other things, to the unusually large number of 17th-18th century park estates, which still survive in the belt from Harewood in the north, through Bramham and Parlington, round to the south-east side of the District at Ledston and Temple Newsam.\n",
      "Today, features such as manor houses, moated buildings, gardens, castles, mills, fishponds and deer parks still survive from this time.\n",
      "Local buildings in Bramham were historically built with Magnesian Limestone, although more recently, brick and other materials are used.   In 2010 study by Natural England3 looked at green infrastructure corridors for Yorkshire and the Humber.\n",
      "It determined that much of the area surrounding Bramham village, (although not the village itself), including Bramham Park, was designated by S19 Limestone Ridge (see map 4: Green Infrastructure Corridor Map4 ). The Limestone Ridge is a subregional corridor which runs from the south of Doncaster to Wetherby.\n",
      "Most of the corridor is rural and it is characterised by large blocks of woodland and rolling farmland bounded by hedges and distinctive limestone buildings.\n",
      "There are also a number of parkland estates including Bramham and, as such, the area has both landscape and historical importance.   Bramham is located within the Magnesian Limestone Belt and is further characterised by gently rolling fields of arable which are bordered by low gappy hedgerows and isolated hedgerow trees, with small pockets of intact pasture occurring around the village fringes.\n",
      "It is surrounded by open arable farmland which typically occurs in the lower lying and gently rolling eastern pans of the district, including east Bramham.\n",
      "The openness of the farmland and lack of woodland allows for long uninterrupted views.   Bramham Moor was unenclosed until the nineteenth century but is now enclosed and cultivated, forming a productive area of large regular fields, interrupted by occasional woodland and patches of pasture.   Map 4: Green infrastructure corridors (Natural England)   The main watercourses that run directly through Bramham are Carr Beck and Bramham Beck.\n",
      "The Environment Agency’s flood maps (map 5 and map 6) indicate that there is a low risk of flooding from rivers and seas and a medium risk of flooding from surface water.   3http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140605112209/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/regions/yorkshire_and_ the_humber/ourwork/yandhgreeninfrastructuremappingproject.aspx \n",

      "text:   The Battle of Bramham Moor took place on Monday 19th February 1408.\n",
      "It was the final battle in the Percy Rebellion of 1402 – 1408 and was between Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland and King Henry IV.\n",
      "The battle ranged over the area bounded by Camp Hill, Headley Hall and Oglethorpe Hills (the highest point of the Moor), either side of the road to Toulston5.     Memorial board    Percy Cross    In February, in heavy snow, Percy’s army marched towards York. Sir Thomas Rokeby, High Sheriff of Yorkshire, heard of Percy’s approach and raised his own army, and blocked the bridge at Knaresborough. Percy’s army advanced through Boroughbridge and Wetherby, and was being pursued by the King’s men, so he went on to Tadcaster, until he stopped and positioned his men on Bramham Moor to await the arrival of Rokeby and his men. The battle started at 2pm, and although it was short, it was said to be furious and bloody. It is generally believed that Rokeby led the charge against Percy and began a violent spree of hand-to-hand combat. Percy’s army was rapidly defeated with Lord Bardolph being fatally wounded and Percy himself lost his life, either by being killed in action or captured and then quickly executed.    The spot where Percy fell was subsequently marked by a memorial stone cross, which was removed to a wood on the edge of the battlefield as it interfered with the farmers’ cultivation of the land.    Moves are afoot to move the cross into the village  where it will better protected and appreciated by  villagers and visitors to the battlefield.    5http://historicbramham.org.uk/battle-of-bramham-moor3.html    Our survey showed that 82% (245 people) wanted the battle of Bramham Moor site and memorial stone to be protected. This Plan therefore identifies the Bramham Moor Battlefield, as specified on map 8, as a valued landscape area. This identification is the equivalent of that covered by the previous policy    H1 for non-designated local heritage assets and has been informed by the same criteria published by Historic England in their Local Heritage Listing Advice Note 7 (May 2016). However, there are key differences in the nature of the site compared to other proposed local heritage assets, and the Steering Group decided to create a separate policy for the Battlefield, recognising:    The extensive nature of the battlefield. The lack of certainty of its precise boundaries i.e. where the battle started or finished.     The essential nature of the land which is almost entirely agricultural with few physical features that distinguish it as an heritage asset from other parts of the adjoining countryside.   In summary, the area covered is recognised for the importance of the historic events that took place there, not for any remaining physical features.   In that non-designated heritage assets are identified by the local planning authority, the Parish Council will nominate the Battlefield and provide the supporting evidence to the City Council for inclusion in the Schedule of non-designated heritage assets maintained by the Council as part of the AMR.   Policy H2 provides protection for the integrity and historic interpretation of the Battlefield as a valued landscape area.   33BRAMHAM NEIGHBOURHOOD DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2018-2033 \n",

      "text:         a) Respect the surrounding and adjacent built form.     To support the continuing use of the University of Leeds Estate for agricultural/research/ academic purposes and other developments which comply with Policy UoL.1  There are three main areas of built development at the site as illustrated in the site plan (Map 16: University of Leeds site map): • Wise Warren Farm - the farm comprises an occupied house and a series of outbuildings that are predominantly unused (see map 16).        Bramham has a unique character that must be preserved and enhanced wherever possible. This does not mean that new ideas and materials should be dismissed but these need to be considered alongside high levels of design to ensure that the unique character of Bramham is never lost. Any alterations, extensions or additions to the built environment need to be carefully considered in order for them to help maintain and enhance the overall appeal of the parish.   b) Reflect local building design, form and style.\n",
      "c) Where possible, reflect the best design within those parts of the Conservation Area, adjacent to the proposed development.\n",
      "d) Take full account of heritage buildings and other assets.\n",
      "e) Encourage innovative building design where appropriate.   c) Where possible, reflect the best design within those parts of the Conservation Area, adjacent to the proposed development. d) Take full account of heritage buildings and other assets. e) Encourage innovative building design where appropriate.    Outside the Conservation Area, there are the areas of housing on the north side of the village together with small pockets of housing elsewhere. The original council estate is a great asset to the village with solidly built houses. Their unique character with spacious gardens especially onto Clifford Road need to be retained. Similarly, the newer estates within the parish have a character of their own. Although they are not unique in their design and similar examples can be found throughout the country they add to diversity of the area.   f) To be supported development proposals must demonstrate they will not result in additional on-street parking of vehicles.   f) To be supported development proposals must demonstrate they will not result in additional on-street parking of vehicles.    The principles of design and detailing of all structures within the Conservation Area should be extended to the remainder of the parish in order that the unique nature of the village is never lost nor dwarfed by buildings of a different nature surrounding the conservation area. In particular, the small hamlet around Headley Hall is quite unique and care should be taken to ensure that it does not lose its appeal owing to its existing character. The parish is a small community in rural surroundings but the existing small spaces within the actual village are vital to the overall appearance and character that we aim to retain and enhance. The spaces are of equal importance to the actual buildings and it is not only the actual spaces enclosed by the buildings but the views that are to be seen between these structures. Over recent years, many spaces have been lost, gardens have been built on and many views blocked. This has had a detrimental effect on the appearance of the village and care must be taken to ensure that the overall character is not destroyed. It is essential that spaces between buildings are given a high priority when consideration is given to any planning application for extensions and in fills. It is not merely the buildings that make the village unique it is the roads, footpaths, courts and spaces between structures that add to the character and well-being of the parish.    The design and detailing of all external spaces are as important as the design of actual buildings that surround them, (including car parking spaces). The character of the area can be greatly enhanced by the detailing of street furniture and materials. The street scene is very important. Care needs to be taken to retain areas of paving and setts and not replacing them with tarmac. The existing stone walls around the parish need to be protected and kept in good order as they add to the character of the parish. Of specific importance are the walls bounding Aberford Road, Windmill Hill and Bowcliffe Road.

These views should be protected.    2. From village square, south towards Almshouse Hill    aim to protect view of traditional village buildings dating from the village’s early history and the war memorial.    The CAAMP notes the importance of key views as follows: “Despite the gradient of Town Hill, Bramham village effectively nestles in a distinct hollow and is therefore not highly visible within the wider landscape, though good views into the village are possible from the outer edges of the settlement. From within the village itself Town Hill and Almshouse Hill offer commanding views of the houses around the historic core, and views out of the village toward the surrounding agricultural and park land are always important.”    3. From the Jubilee Gardens, south towards village centre – aim to protect view of traditional dwellings leading to village square.    4. From cattle ramp towards the Red Lion public house – aim to protect view of historic cattle ramp, Carr Beck, public house, and square.    5. From village square towards Senior Citizens’ Centre and garden – aim to protect view of traditional building and green space in the heart of the village facing the square.    6. From Lyndon Road incorporating green space and then north towards Clifford – aim to protect view of green space on Lyndon Road and rural aspect to north of village.    In addition, the Core Strategy Policy P10: Design, states that development will protect and enhance locally important buildings, spaces, skylines and views. There are eight key short range views and nine key long range views in to and out of Bramham. These are illustrated in map 13 and map 14 and noted as follows: 7. From the junction of Aberford Road and Freely Lane looking north up Freely Lane – aim to protect view of Historic building (Bramham Lodge) and playing field opposite.    8. From Almshouse Hill looking north over the village    aim to protect view of panorama over village centre.    Short range views:    1. From New Road, east towards All Saints’ Church – aim to protect view of historic church and churchyard.    Long range views:    1. From Aberford Road south east down Headley Lane – aim to protect view of open countryside and agricultural land in south of Bramham parish. 5. South along Windmill Road, looking uphill towards the Windmill – aim to protect open countryside with view of the historic windmill.    6. Oglethorpe Hills towards Oglethorpe Hall Farm – aim to protect open countryside on eastern edge of village giving view of historic farmhouse.    2.

Policies summarised    UoL1: University of Leeds Estate    Objectives addressed    The University of Leeds have owned or leased the majority of the land identified on the site location plan (Map 15 University of Leeds estate boundary) since around the 1940s. The site was originally predominantly used for teaching and research on arable, dairy and pig production.    In the 1990s, the University leased much of the land to a wholly owned subsidiary company called the University of Leeds Farms Ltd. However, since this point the use of the farms for teaching has broadly declined. Many of the current buildings within the site are vacant and in need of repair, e.g. Wise Warren Farm.    13% (39 respondents) answered, I am against all forms of development associated with renewable energy within Bramham Parish.    49% (145 respondents) answered, yes, providing it is small scale and out of sight.    The University are currently in the process of dissolving the University of Leeds Farms Ltd and developing a new estate strategy. The intention is to dissolve the limited company with a view to managing the estate within the Facilities Directorate under a new structure. The research activities will bring some buildings on the three existing farms back into use where possible. However, it is likely that some vacant buildings will need to be converted to other viable uses (eg residential). There is the potential to convert the existing agricultural barns at Wise Warren Farm to dwellings.    The University consider there is potential to develop   renewable energy solutions on the estate (eg a solar farm) and these could be linked to the existing expansion of research activity at Spen Farm.   farm) and these could be linked to the existing  expansion of research activity at Spen Farm.    • Headley Hall Farm – the site comprises of a collection of disused farm buildings.

The style of building moved from the Edwardian (e.g. Compton Terrace on School Lane) to the more ‘Suburban Modernist’ style of the 1930s (e.g. Old Brookside, Garth End, houses on Linton Road).\n",

Fish & Son (Builders) Ltd who later went on to develop the paddocks around Beck House on Church Lane and the land previously occupied by part of the Coal Yard on Station Lane.   28.10 The style of these houses has come to characterize the ‘Collingham Style’ i.e.\n",

      "Of these, 15 households would be seeking to move within the parish.\n",
      "One of these households was a concealed household.   5.26 On a simple demand and supply basis there is a demand for 15 homes and a potential supply of 40 homes released by the moving households over the next 5 years.\n",
      "This is a potential surplus of existing homes which would be occupied by households who currently do not live in the parish.\n",
      "However the purpose of our analysis is to establish the net requirement for additional housing generated by parish residents.   5.27 If we take into account a further 5 local households that have indicated they may stay in the parish if suitable housing became available and assume it does become available, the local demand rises to 20 homes over a five year period.\n",
      "We propose to base further analysis on this 20 households as none of the 5 households stated a preferred or alternative location.   5.28 The next stage of analysis is to investigate if some of the supply of homes from the 40 moving households will meet the requirements from the 20 households that told us they may want to move within the parish.\n",
      "The sequencing of household moves is a crucial factor.\n",
      "A suitable home becoming vacant in year 1 will not be available for a household seeking to move a later year.\n",
      "So we have undertaken a more detailed assessment of demand from local households seeking to move, in terms of their requirements for size type and tenure and compared it to the size type and tenure of the supply from the moving households both planning to move and seeking to move in the same year.\n",
      "This is a modelled approach and the matching of supply and demand may not happen in practice.\n",
      "However the approach is justified because of the high proportion of moving households that want to move home within the parish and the qualitative evidence we obtained at the neighbourhood planning consultation events.\n",
      "The qualitative evidence can be summarised as households see the parish as a destination of choice and once they achieve this they seek to remain there.\n",
      "Networking by village residents means that vacancies are considered by potential local purchasers or renters before they are offered for sale on the open market.   5.29 Four potential matches exist between the supply of vacant housing and the requirements of households that are seeking to move home.\n",
      "A further potential match exists between the supply of vacant housing and one household that indicated that they would stay within the parish if suitable housing became available.\n",
      "This means that 11 households planning to move within the parish will be unable to find suitable housing from the vacancies generated by the moving households.\n",
      "This adds an important dimension to our assessment of locally generated need.\n",
      "The basis of our assessment of local need for additional housing is due to a mismatch of housing types and sizes between supply and demand rather than a crude assessment of a net surplus identified above.   5.30 The evidence below suggests that the mismatch is entirely plausible.\n",
      "Put simply the ageing population is seeking to downsize and some will require specialist housing when they move home. \n",

      "text:   The Aberford Neighbourhood Development Plan (NDP/‘Neighbourhood Plan’) is a new type of community-led planning document introduced by Government in the 2011 Localism Act. Neighbourhood Plans are part of a raft of new community rights to enable local communities to better shape their places.   A Neighbourhood Plan can be used to decide where new development takes place, what type it should be and what it should look like, together with other matters of local interest such as open space and community facilities.\n",
      "It cannot be used to stop development already allocated or permitted, or propose less development than that in the Local Plan (principally, the Leeds Core Strategy and Site Allocations Plan).\n",
      "It could, however, propose more development than the Local Plan if a community was so minded.\n",
      "Neighbourhood Plans also provide the opportunity for communities to set out other non-planning actions and aspirations so that the resultant document presents a holistic framework for the future of an area over the next 10 to 15 years (up to 2028 in the case of Aberford).   The process of producing a plan also provides an opportunity for communities to work with their District Council on the allocation of sites as well as other corporate objectives, such as improving equality, cohesion and integration and recognising diversity.   Once adopted, the plan forms part of the statutory Local Plan (The Leeds Local Plan) and carries real legal weight in decisions on planning applications and planning appeals.   The decision to produce a Neighbourhood Plan for Aberford was taken by Aberford and District Parish Council on 17th January 2012 in response to the Government’s publication of the Localism Bill, on the grounds that it would enable the community to have more of a say in the future development of the local area, albeit within certain limits and parameters.\n",
      "It was felt that taking the step to produce a plan was a necessary move forward in order to protect and form the future shape of the village, allowing local residents to air their views throughout the process.\n",
      "This imperative was strengthened by Leeds City Council’s work on a Local Plan and a search for housing sites, several of which were initially identified within the parish. \n",

While small scale improvements will prolong the life of the hall in the short term and monies have been identified for refurbishment works, the trustees’ view is that the hall needs substantial investment to secure its long term future.\n",
      "In recent years, the trustees have worked closely with the owner of the land behind the hall to submit a joint planning application to build additional housing for the village, while also providing much needed off-road parking for the village hall, together with a substantial cash payment to enable a major refurbishment of the hall.\n",

      "text:   It is unclear when exactly a settlement first developed at Garforth.   The magnesian limestone to the east of Leeds is rich farming land and it is probable that the area was cultivated by the Romans.   It seems likely that the origin of the name Garforth is Anglo-Saxon.\n",
      "The two words mean “ford by a triangular piece of land”.\n",
      "The whole area was annexed by the Kingdom of Northumbria in AD 617.\n",
      "Some evidence of settlement was found near Parlington Hollins in advance of the construction of the A1-M1 link, but the evidence suggested a loosely arranged community rather than a “village”.   The first detailed description of Garforth comes in the Domesday Survey compiled in 1086.\n",
      "The manor of Garforth was 1.5 miles long and 1.5 miles wide.\n",
      "There was a church, a priest, 4 villagers and 1 smallholder.\n",
      "As only heads of families were counted the figures are an underestimate for the population of the village.   Slight traces of the medieval field system can still be seen as ridge and furrow in grassed areas such as Garforth Golf Course.   The ownership of the land changed a number of times and, eventually, by the late 18th century was largely in the hands of the Gascoigne family, where it remained.   There had been mining in the area for some time, probably since the 13th century, but the Gascoigne family extended the scope of mining, although, at this stage the mining was not deep.\n",
      "However, between 1830 and 1840 the first shafts were sunk, and mining began on a more industrial scale.   The population increased significantly to reflect the work available in the pits.\n",
      "In 1831 the population was 782; by 1899 it was 3,224, an increase of 400% in 70 years.   There was significant flooding at the colliery in the 1870s and 1880s and the pits eventually closed in 1930.   There was a large surge in house building in the 1960s and 1970s on land surrounding Garforth.\n",
      "The town provided a convenient location with relatively affordable housing and good transport links to the city of Leeds and beyond More recent expansion can be traced to a combination of overall economic success in Leeds and Garforth’s excellent transport links.\n",
      "The two railway stations allow easy and quick access to Leeds.\n",
      "The A1 and M1 pass nearby and in 1999 the roads were linked by the extension of the M1 which passes to the west and north of Garforth.\n",
      "Unusually there are two motorway junctions, each within less than a mile of Garforth.\n",
      "The M1 extension has led to rapid development of commercial, light industrial and residential sites clustered around Junctions 46 and 47.\n",
      "In addition the M62 is less than 10 miles away. \n",

      "Despite this, it has many attractive areas, and, a vibrancy and variety of social and cultural options which make it a desirable place to live.  4.5     Wood Lane, Headingley Hill, Cardigan Road and North Hyde Park have leafy avenues surrounding large stone Victorian villas set back in large plots with mature trees and stone boundary walls, although many have been subdivided into flats (19% of residential accommodation is in converted properties) or used as offices.\n",
      "There are 3 Conservation Areas containing Listed Buildings, which are subject to separate legislation.\n",
      "(see maps on page 13 and 14).  4.6     The Turnways and Beckett Park estates are splendid examples of substantial interwar semi-detached housing set within large gardens.  4.7     A large percentage of houses in the plan area are semi- detached or terraced houses, most originally 2 or 3 bedroom houses built for families although many have been extended/enlarged.\n",
      "Many of these are good, sound houses.\n",
      "Many are privately rented, 60% of the population live in rented accommodation.  4.8     The major local issue over the past 25 years has been the rapid shift from long term occupation to Houses in Multiple Occupancy (HMOs).\n",
      "The council and local community have worked hard to moderate the impact of this, and now, as a result of HMO legislation, market developments (new student housing in the city centre) and community work, we have reached a stage where housing occupancy is gradually shifting from a shorter- to a longer-term pattern.  4.9     Our boundaries are largely formed by expanses of green space: Meanwood Beck and Woodhouse Ridge; Woodhouse Moor; Batcliffe Wood and Beckett Park.  4.10     The Town Centre combines commercial property, community buildings and homes, like the original village stone cottages on Otley Road.\n",

      "For home ownership this is complicated by the fact that a deposit which is a percentage of the purchase price is required by lenders.\n",
      "First time buyers are facing anything up to a 20% deposit under present market conditions dependent on the lender standard terms and the borrower’s credit history.\n",
      "Existing home owners with a good credit rating would normally be able to fund their deposit from equity from the sale of their home.\n",
      "It is noteworthy that the Help to Buy scheme means that a 5% deposit applies and this is particularly popular with households seeking to buy new build housing.\n",
      "T   2.55 As an illustration, assuming a first time buyer in a single income household paid a 10% deposit on a home with a, £110,000 asking price, they would need a £99,000 mortgage.\n",
      "According to CLG guidance, a single income household would need an annual income of around £28,300 to service this loan, the loan being  3.5 times their annual income.     2.56 The A58-A64 North Quadrant Local Housing Market and Needs Assessment by consultants ‘re’new’, commissioned by Persimmon Homes in 2012 contains information about the average income levels across the city as at February 2011. We believe it is reasonable to quote this information as there has been recent wage restraint for many years.\n",
      "Average wages were quoted as being per annum:  • City centre £16,587;  • The golden triangle £34,959;  • The inner area £17,241;  • The outer area £27,907; and  • Leeds average £24,173     2.57 Using the illustration above and taking into account the parish house price information and these average income levels, it is clear that most households in Leeds are priced out of the parish housing market unless they have significant savings or equity in their current home.   2.58 Although there is relatively little rented housing in the parish it is helpful to understand the affordability of rented housing.\n",
      "Government practice guidance suggests that 25% of household income or less should be affordable to households.\n",
      "So a household income equivalent to the minimum wage would suggest that the household should pay no more than £250 per calendar month (pcm).\n",
      "Such households would seek to close the gap between this and market rents by claiming housing benefit.   2.59 Further, most letting agents use a different method for assessing whether a prospective tenant can afford the tenancy on offer.\n",
      "Their starting point is the rent not the tenant’s income.\n",
      "They multiply the rent by 30 to arrive at the minimum income that would be required without a guarantor.\n",
      "This means that a rent of say, £400 pcm requires an income of £12,000 pa which is close to the minimum wage.\n",
      "Tenants with lower incomes than 30 times rent will require a guarantor in addition to a tenancy deposit.\n",
      "However practice guidance would suggest that someone on this income should reasonably be able to afford a rent of £250.   The discrepancy between practice guidance and industry practice is noteworthy and means that the tenant will pay 1.6 times more rent than the government suggests they can reasonably afford.   2.60 This above explains why many younger people will struggle to achieve home ownership in the early stages of their working lives and rely upon the private rented sector to supply the housing they can afford.\n",
      "The absence of a large private rented sector in the parish coupled with a low proportion of smaller homes means that the parish does not have a housing offer that is either suitable for or affordable to the majority of younger households seeking housing.\n",
      "There is a good supply of rented housing in the wider Leeds housing market area. \n",

      "The pressures to change are called ‘housing market drivers’.   3.2 These drivers are social and economic factors that affect the housing market and are measured by:  • demographic trends (net changes in the number of people and the type of households that form);  • changing housing market conditions;  • change in prices and affordability (the relationship between house prices or rents and income); and  • change in public policy (national and local planning policy, fiscal policy and regulation).     3.3 Data describing many of the above issues is normally measured at city level so we have sought the information from the most recent strategic housing market assessments (SHMA) published by Leeds City Council. \n",

      "This is smaller than the rate of change for England;   • new housebuilding is running at over 2,000 homes per annum across the City and this number of completion is expected to rise;   • the volume of sales dropped dramatically after 2008 and is only recently showing signs of recovery.\n",

      "text:   7.2 The evidence suggests that the parish has many features that distinguish it from the city, the region and England.\n",
      "Compared to these larger geographies the key differences are:  • over the decade between the 2001 and 2011 censuses the parish population has declined even though the number of households increased, due to decreasing average household size;  • there are fewer young children and young adults;  • there are considerably more people over the age of 65;  • people that are economically active are more likely to be in higher and medium level occupations; and  • people are healthier and are less likely to have limitations in their day to day activities even though there is a high proportion of older residents in the parish.     7.3 There are significant trends within in the population:  • a declining number of young people resident in the parish; and  • a growing number of older people resident in the parish.     7.4 The housing stock:  • has a very high proportion of detached houses and bungalows with a very low proportion of terraced homes, flats and apartments;  • has a high proportion (over 75%) of homes that have 3 bedrooms or more;  • generates a low supply of re-sales and re-lets as households tend to stay resident in the parish long term;  • generates high demand, driven by easy access to labour markets by road, a high quality environment and good schools.\n",
      "The parish is described as ‘a place to move up to’.  • is consequently more expensive than average prices for Leeds and the region  • is unlikely to be affordable to households on average income unless they can find significant deposits; and  • is unlikely to be affordable to first time buyers.     7.5 There is little supply of social or affordable housing in the parish.\n",
      "Although many households on the waiting list for social housing aspire to live in the parish, limited supply from relets means that there is only a small amount of active demand   The Leeds housing market context   7.6 The key finding of our review are that:  • the parish local housing market sits within the outer north east quadrant of the city;  • the population of Leeds grew by about 5% in the decade 2001-2011; due mainly to an excess of births over deaths in the city however there is an outflow of people from Leeds to other local authority areas;  • the number of households is rising at a slightly faster rate than the population due to the diminishing average size of households across the city.\n",
      "This is smaller than the rate of change for England;  • new housebuilding is running at over 2,000 homes per annum across the City and this number of completion is expected to rise;  • the volume of sales dropped dramatically after 2008 and is only recently showing signs of recovery.\n",
      "Land registry data quoted in Chapter 2 suggests that the parish was less affected by this; and  • average house prices and the affordability of housing in Leeds are higher than across the region but below the average for England.     7.7 Our household survey revealed some public support for additional housing for first time buyers and older people.\n",

      "With low vacancy rates in our experience applicants in housing need will consider options in other locations.   7.12 Low numbers of concealed households seeking to live independently within the parish are to be expected because if wishing to purchase they are priced out of the market within the parish setting.\n",

Interpreting local need estimates, policy considerations and conclusion   7.14 Housing surveys have been relied upon for decades as the main method of estimating local housing requirements.\n",
      "More recently the approach is used in smaller geographies such as wards and parishes rather than boroughs, districts and cities.\n",
      "This study develops the basic approach as it looks across all of the housing tenures to arrive at a net requirement for additional housing rather than a narrow focus on the need for social or affordable housing.\n",
      "The key finding is that the underlying cause the requirement for additional housing because there is a mismatch between the size type and tenure of potential vacancies to the requirements of households that plan to move home.   7.15 It is important to recognise that this is a snapshot of household circumstances aspirations.\n",
      "The method cannot take account of unexpected change in housing requirements due to, for example relationship breakdown or household dissolution due to death.   7.16 The estimate of local need is an estimate not a probability.\n",
      "It should be regarded as an order of magnitude and not be applied prescriptively.\n",
      "Taking the survey findings and the supporting evidence into account there is very strong evidence to support policies that address imbalances in the parish household and dwelling profile and its predicted demographic change.   7.18 The evidence base that has been produced contains significant and wide ranging information to enable the parish council and the public to consider housing policy and development proposals in an informed way. \n",

B5: Chapel Lane: east of the Conservation Area is an area important to the village because it encompasses much of the accessible formal greenspace – football and cricket pitches - along with the primary school, cricket pavilion, village hall, bowling club and allotments.\n",
      "From a housing perspective, the main feature is the former Council stock built around the Croftway and Welfare Avenue in 1938, with earlier housing on Chapel Lane displaying interesting design features, including concrete lintels, blue slate roofing and mock tudor gable ends.

Any new development will still maintain substantial separation from our neighbouring villages and minimise the quantity of land required but will also be in keeping with the density of housing characteristic of the area.   2. New housing will include a number of smaller dwellings   3. Good design will enhance the appearance of any new development and contribute to Collingham being a pleasant place to live.   4. New development will be designed to sit sensitively within the existing environment and retain Collingham’s history and heritage.   5. Architectural features that add positively to Collingham’s village character will be replicated.   6. Development will protect and complement the landscape generally including agricultural land, woodland, wildlife habitats, and in particular the key views into and out of the village.   7. The Parish Council and residents will be involved in the scrutiny of planning proposals and delivery of the Plan.   8. All existing infrastructure, services, and facilities will be protected, enhanced and enjoyed by an increasing number of residents.   9. Open space will be provided with the maximum degree of protection through the Planning system. \n",

Strategy and Site Allocations Plan, provides the policy basis for the vision set out in the Holbeck SPD for that area; in particular, the aim to:   • “create a mixed-use, sustainable community with a distinctive sense of place, which exemplifies best practice in regeneration and sustainable development;   • improve … links to the surrounding communities of Beeston Hill and Holbeck;   • create new opportunities for employment and skills, living and leisure, and;   • further enable the growth of key economic sectors in the area, including creative and digital, high quality and modern manufacturing”.   3.1.5 The South Bank Planning Framework, due to be adopted in 2017, also sets out a direction for the development of the wider area, including the Holbeck SPD area and thus part of this Neighbourhood Plan area.   3.1.6 Regeneration in Holbeck is also aimed at improving the health and well-being of residents.\n",
      "Improvements in social cohesion, integration, housing, employment and training can all have significant positive effects on health.   3.1.7 Further regeneration is required, continuing and expanding the work currently taking place.\n",
      "A more attractive and healthier place for all means firstly taking steps to identify and preserve Holbeck\\'s assets: its distinctive qualities, its heritage and its green spaces.\n",
      "Where improvement is needed, the Neighbourhood Plan includes policies and projects to help bring this about.   3.1.8 A distinctive and successful local centre as a focus for a neighbourhood helps provide identity, as do the facilities that enable a community to be more cohesive and mutually supportive; places for people of all ages to meet and enjoy on a formal and informal basis.\n",
      "The Neighbourhood Plan includes policies and projects to strengthen the function and use of the local centre and community facilities, to mitigate the effects of traffic and make it easier, safer and more pleasant to walk and cycle in the area. \n",

      "The population of Collingham is described by the census information included in Table 1.   17.3 This indicates the population is becoming older, and the proportion over 75 at 12.8% is already higher than that in Wetherby (10.6%) and much higher than that across Leeds (7.0%).\n",
      "Currently 20.7% of residents in Collingham are between the ages of 60 and 75.\n",
      "Assuming residents choose to remain in Collingham then the proportion of over 75 is very likely to be even greater at the end of the Plan period.   17.4 Conversely, the proportion of people of ‘family building’ age (25 – 44) is almost half the city average, and there has been a significant reduction in this demographic over ten years.   17.5 Over the Plan period it is estimated that there will be a 16% increase in households over 65; a 30% increase in over 75s, a 70% increase in over 85s (see CS paragraph 5.2.39).   17.6 The logical conclusion from these statistics is that there will be a demand for suitable housing for an ageing population and for those that wish to move, this demand is likely to be for smaller dwellings.   17.7 This conclusion is shared by Leeds Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) Update (GVA and Edge Analytics, May 2011).\n",
      "The SHMA analysis suggests that Leeds is likely to see a continued growth in single person and couple households, with a relatively small rise in family households.\n",
      "The analysis also points to a rising demand for smaller properties based on the projected increase in couple and single person households.\n",
      "In total, it is estimated that 55% of demand for new stock will be for two-bedroom properties.   17.8 Table 2 shows the housing stock in the Parish compared with the housing stock across Leeds.\n",
      "This shows a relative deficit in the number of smaller properties.\n",
      "Due to the characteristics of the area it is not reasonable to expect the deficit to be removed completely, but this does show the type of housing which is likely to be required.   17.9 The Parish Council considers that proposals should therefore include smaller housing designed to the latest accessible housing standards and that consideration should be given towards the provision of level access flats, bungalows and sheltered housing schemes. \n",

      "With a population of some 15,000 (2011 Census) the town is large enough to provide those who live there with a wide range of facilities.\n",
      "There are 5 primary schools and 1 secondary school.\n",
      "There are numerous clubs, societies and leisure opportunities.\n",
      "Within easy travelling distance of Leeds and York, the town has the advantages of access to major conurbations while retaining the community feel of a place where it is common to meet people you know on the Main Street.   The variety of shops, pubs and restaurants means that locals can often find what they want in the town with regard to retail and entertainment.\n",
      "As a result of increased home working in light of the Covid crisis, it seems probable that this trend to “shop local” could prove a boon to the town and safeguard the future of its high street and businesses.   As a small town, separated from Leeds and surrounded by fields, Garforth offers easy access to the countryside on foot and by bicycle through a number of footpaths and bridlepaths.\n",
      "As people examine their lifestyle in view of the health crises the ability to take advantage of this proximity to the countryside is a major plus for our town.   The huge challenge we are all confronting is climate change.\n",
      "LCC’s recent declaration of a climate emergency stresses this point.\n",
      "However, the Forum is confident that, given the policies in our Plan which aim to address the issues surrounding global warming, we can ensure Garforth remains a great place to live in the years ahead.\n",

      "There are often issues with traffic jams, parking problems, delayed or cancelled trains and buses not running to time.\n",
      "Perhaps some of the issues could be partly resolved by people making different travel choices.   2. Public transport is widely used- although often maligned- and there is undoubtedly scope for improvement with regard to reliability and pricing.\n",
      "However, the notion that walking or cycling could form part of our journey planning is still alien to many people.\n",
      "Part of the issue is habit.\n",
      "Part is (perceived) convenience.\n",
      "But an even greater barrier is the lack of adequate infrastructure for walking and cycling.   3. If this key issue can be addressed, the benefits to the individual and to society in terms of better health and less pollution would be considerable.   4. Looking at Garforth, it seems sensible to consider how we could help make it easier for people to make the best transport choice for the journey they are making whether within the town or beyond.   5. Clearly, the notion of “best transport choice” may have different meanings for different people.\n",
      "However, given that we are all responsible for the choices we make and given the current crises in our country with regard to obesity and health in general, it would seem sensible that good transport choices would not contribute to worsening the situation with regard to these national problems.\n",
      "If you add in the issues of global warming and air pollution caused by vehicle emissions, it seems clear that we can begin to see what a good travel choice might imply.   6. The National Planning Policy Framework is unequivocal here.\n",
      "Paragraph112 states, “applications for development should: a) give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and with neighbouring areas; and second – so far as possible – to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for bus or other public transport services, and appropriate facilities that encourage public transport use’’   7. In summary, when considering journeys people make in and around Garforth it is feasible to encourage people to make choices about how they travel which will benefit both themselves in terms of their health and wellbeing and the planet in terms of reducing emissions. \n",

      "This development, projected to provide 9,000 dwellings between Redhall and Thorpe Park plus a dual carriageway orbital relief road, is located outside the Neighbourhood Area but has the potential for considerable impact on the community of Scholes, in particular, by the generation of traffic and visual intrusion.   A Housing Needs Assessment undertaken by Chris Broughton Associates in 2015 provided the following key information about the housing characteristics and needs of the parish:  1. The evidence suggests that the parish has many features that distinguish it from the city, the region and England.\n",
      "Compared to these larger geographies the key differences are:  over the decade between the 2001 and 2011 censuses the parish population has declined even though the number of households increased, due to decreasing average household size;  there are fewer young children and young adults;  there are considerably more people over the age of 65;  people that are economically active are more likely to be in higher and medium level occupations;  people are healthier and are less likely to have limitations in their day to day activities even though there is a high proportion of older residents in the parish.  2. In respect of the housing stock, the parish:  has a very high proportion of detached houses and bungalows with a very low proportion of terraced homes, flats and apartments;  has a high proportion (over 75%) of homes that have 3 bedrooms or more;  generates a low supply of re-sales and re-lets as households tend to stay resident in the parish long term;  generates high demand, driven by easy access to labour markets by road, a high quality environment and good schools.\n",
      "The parish is described as ‘a place to move up to’.  is consequently more expensive than average prices for Leeds and the region  is unlikely to be affordable to households on average income unless they can find significant deposits; and  is unlikely to be affordable to first time buyers.      3. There is little supply of social or affordable housing in the parish.\n",
      "Although many households on the waiting list for social housing aspire to live in the parish, limited supply from relets means that there is only a small amount of active demand.  4. The main priorities for residents of the parish in respect of housing provision were for future homes to have on plot parking; a private garden; high standards of energy efficiency; a garage; be suited for first time buyers and older people.\n",
      "Residents felt that town houses and large family homes should be a low priority.  5. The information showed that over the next five years more housing would become vacant in the parish than was required by local households seeking to move home within the parish.\n",
      "However because of the limited diversity in the housing stock and choices made by aging households to downsize there was a mismatch between the likely supply of housing and the requirement of households seeking to move.\n",

      "text:   1. The objectives of the plan include maintaining, improving and increasing the provision of green spaces, promoting healthy lifestyles, protecting and maintaining access to the green infrastructure around Garforth, protecting and enhancing the rural environment, landscape and the habitats network around Garforth.   2. Easy and safe access to local parks, allotments, outdoor sporting venues, safe children’s play facilities and high-quality open spaces are vital to the health and wellbeing of a community enabling social interaction, play and recreational activities.\n",
      "Regular exercise, sporting and leisure activities, particularly outdoors, are critical to maintaining active and healthy lifestyles.   3. Green spaces provide the infrastructure necessary to support the growth of trees, hedges and other vegetation to improve air quality, carbon sequestration and flood risk mitigation, all of which contribute to the solutions necessary to address the climate emergency.   4. The rural environment, a natural heritage, also provides opportunities for sustaining wildlife especially pollinating insects vital to food production.   5. The Covid pandemic has highlighted the importance of accessible green spaces for physical and mental health.\n",
      "Medical journals state that it is not just physical exercise but activity in a green environment and engagement with nature that is essential to preserve health and the Office of National Statistics (ONS) has stated that one in eight households do not have access to their own garden1.   6. The key benefits of green space are:  • Natural heritage, providing opportunities for wildlife opportunities for addressing health and wellbeing inequalities  • Social sustainability and opportunities for social interaction  • Play and recreation  • Climate change mitigation and reduction  • Flood risk mitigation; and  • Air quality improvements and carbon sequestration.     7. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s report on the Social Value of Public Spaces2 outlines the benefits of public space to the cultural and social life of communities, finding that parks and open public spaces are integral to the creation of a local identity and better sense of place.   8. The University of Leeds Guide to the benefits of Urban Green Spaces 3 states:   “Urban green spaces such as domestic gardens, parks and woodland provide a multitude of benefits to urban populations and a vital habitat for wildlife.\n",
      "By improving physical fitness and reducing depression, the presence of green spaces can enhance the health and wellbeing of people.\n",
      "Green spaces also indirectly impact on health by improving air quality and limiting the impact of heatwaves by reducing urban temperatures.\n",
      "In addition, urban vegetation stores carbon, helping to mitigate climate change and reduces the likelihood of flooding by storing excess water.”   9. The Landscape Institute identifies 5 key principles that capture the benefits of linking landscape and health4: \n",

Description Why is the feature of interest and significance? What evidence exists to support the proposed selection?  Coal, ganister* and fireclay mine and quarry remains.    Basis of Designation    There is a long history of quarrying and bell mining in the Hunger Hills area. It is considered that the remaining visible structures are significant heritage assets. The extent of this can be seen in the geological map below, believed to be dated 1840 and in the 1934 Ordnance Survey Map.    Ganister Quarry    The ganister quarry was located to the north and west of the top of Hunger Hills Wood. There are fine long-distance views over it from Hunger Hills Wood, especially to the south-west. See image 1 below. Visually there remain elevated spoil heaps next to the quarry’s boundary with the Hunger Hills Wood, these being seen best from the vantage points of images 2 and 3 below. It is likely that archaeological work near to the spoil heaps would uncover buildings and equipment structures that are covered over. It is believed that the quarry was filled-in progressively after 1948 by local waste removal and land fill.   \n",

      "text:   Objectives addressed   £     Developing community and business infrastructure: To ensure residents live in communities that provide for their needs through enabling the provision of education, recreation and employment opportunities.  Maintaining the natural environment and distinctive character: To preserve and enhance the rural character of the Neighbourhood Area, ensuring that new development is compatible with the built and natural environment, preserves historic features, observes the Conservation Area Management Plan, the height and scale of existing buildings and protects and improves local landscapes.    5.5.1 Small business development    Issues    The community relies upon small businesses to provide the majority of employment opportunities for residents who do not commute out of the parish. There is a need then to become, as far as is practicable, ‘open for business’ as far as small business is concerned where impacts upon residential areas is often minimal. Evidence    Nearly 200 people are employed by local businesses currently according to surveys, and this is likely to be a considerable under representation. There are over 160 VAT registered businesses in the parish with more that are not registered and, therefore, more or less invisible. Main Street in Barwick in Elmet and Station Road in Scholes are both home to a variety of retail and service businesses. Agriculture is the major commercial land use in the Neighbourhood Area. Land cultivated is primarily held by tenant farmers and agricultural viability should be preserved. The land farmed has good rates of crop production averaging above 4 ton of wheat per acre. Some land is also used for oil seed rape and potatoes, with small areas used for grazing.   The villages benefit from a number of economic sites, primarily on the enterprise park on Aberford Road in Barwick in Elmet and on York Road at Morwick Hall in Scholes. Morwick Hall and the surrounding annexes provide thirty varied business users with accommodation. The development of a business ‘start-up site’ for eighteen light industrial units and a training block has been proposed at Holmecroft, located on a brownfield site, a former scrap yard adjacent to the A64. Langland’s Garden Centre and other commercial enterprises are also located on the A64. Retail outlets are also established in both villages, primarily in the village centres and along the main thoroughfares. In addition there are also numerous small and home based businesses including plumbers, electricians, accountancy and other sole traders who have been consulted throughout the preparation of this plan.    The consultation on the first draft NP revealed 90% support from respondents for the policy to support small businesses.     67Barwick in Elmet and Scholes Neighbourhood Plan 2016 \n",

      "The Neighbourhood Plan aims to ensure that all the housing, current and future, in Garforth is of a quality that underpins the wellbeing of those who live there.\n",
      "It is also important to have a range of suitably priced housing that does not exclude significant sectors of our community from living here   2. At the same time there is no assumption in the Plan that large scale housing development will take place in Garforth.\n",
      "GNPF is not promoting any sites for development.\n",
      "The purpose of the HBE section is to try to ensure that housing development in Garforth in the years ahead meets the needs of the town and takes into account climate change in line with the policies developed here.   3. The question of infrastructure is critical in any new development.\n",
      "Green infrastructure is dealt with fully in the Green space and Environment section of the Plan.\n",
      "Suffice it to reiterate here that, as the town already suffers from a significant deficit in terms of green space (using Leeds City Council guidelines), it is vital that all new developments take the opportunity to provide the required amount.\n",
      "In addition, issues of accessibility and connectivity are vital in any new development.\n",
      "New housing needs to be connected to other parts of the town via a network of good pedestrian and cycle routes to help address issues around emissions from cars and contribute to improving the overall health and wellbeing of residents.   4. One of the biggest challenges facing the human race in the 21st century is how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
      "Housing accounts for roughly 14% of these emissions.\n",
      "Between 1990 and 2019 emissions fell from 80 million tons of CO2 to just under 70 million.\n",
      "However, between 2014 and 2020 emissions have fluctuated around 65 million tons1.\n",
      "In order for local and national reduction targets to be met, it is essential that much more effort is put into reducing the carbon footprint of new build homes   5. It is vital for the sake of future generations that construction standards regarding energy efficiency are rapidly raised so that all new buildings emit a hugely reduced level of greenhouse gases both from their construction and during their lifetime. \n",
