It provides a framework\\nwithin which locally-prepared plans can provide for sufficient housing and other\\ndevelopment in a sustainable manner. Preparing and maintaining up-to-date plans\\nshould be seen as a priority in meeting this objective.\\n2.\\nPlanning law requires that applications for planning permission be determined in\\naccordance with the development plan2, unless material considerations indicate\\notherwise3. The National Planning Policy Framework must be taken into account in\\npreparing the development plan, and is a material consideration in planning\\ndecisions. Planning policies and decisions must also reflect relevant international\\nobligations and statutory requirements.\\n3.\\nThe Framework should be read as a whole (including its footnotes and annexes).\\nGeneral references to planning policies in the Framework should be applied in a\\nway that is appropriate to the type of plan being produced, taking into account\\npolicy on plan-making in chapter 3.\\n4.\\nThe Framework should be read in conjunction with the Government’s planning\\npolicy for traveller sites, and its planning policy for waste. When preparing plans or\\nmaking decisions on applications for these types of development, regard should\\nalso be had to the policies in this Framework, where relevant.\\n5.\\nThe Framework does not contain specific policies for nationally significant\\ninfrastructure projects. These are determined in accordance with the decision-\\nmaking framework in the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and relevant national\\npolicy statements for major infrastructure, as well as any other matters that are\\nrelevant (which may include the National Planning Policy Framework). National\\npolicy statements form part of the overall framework of national planning policy, and\\nmay be a material consideration in preparing plans and making decisions on\\nplanning applications.\\n6.\\nOther statements of government policy may be material when preparing plans or\\ndeciding applications, such as relevant Written Ministerial Statements and\\nendorsed recommendations of the National Infrastructure Commission. This\\nincludes the Written Ministerial Statement on Affordable Homes Update (24 May\\n2021) which contains policy on First Homes.\",\n",

Achieving sustainable development\\n7.\\nThe purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of\\nsustainable development, including the provision of homes, commercial\\ndevelopment, and supporting infrastructure in a sustainable manner. At a very high\\nlevel, the objective of sustainable development can be summarised as meeting the\\nneeds of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet\\ntheir own needs4. At a similarly high level, members of the United Nations –\\nincluding the United Kingdom – have agreed to pursue the 17 Global Goals for\\nSustainable Development in the period to 2030. These address social progress,\\neconomic well-being and environmental protection5.\\n\\n8.\\nAchieving sustainable development means that the planning system has three\\noverarching objectives, which are interdependent and need to be pursued in\\nmutually supportive ways (so that opportunities can be taken to secure net gains\\nacross each of the different objectives):\\n\\na) an economic objective – to help build a strong, responsive and competitive\\neconomy, by ensuring that sufficient land of the right types is available in the\\nright places and at the right time to support growth, innovation and improved\\nproductivity; and by identifying and coordinating the provision of infrastructure;\\n\\nb) a social objective – to support strong, vibrant and healthy communities, by\\nensuring that a sufficient number and range of homes can be provided to meet\\nthe needs of present and future generations; and by fostering well-designed,\\nbeautiful and safe places, with accessible services and open spaces that\\nreflect current and future needs and support communities’ health, social and\\ncultural well-being; and\\n\\nc) an environmental objective – to protect and enhance our natural, built and\\nhistoric environment; including making effective use of land, improving\\nbiodiversity, using natural resources prudently, minimising waste and pollution,\\nand mitigating and adapting to climate change, including moving to a low\\ncarbon economy.\\n\\n9.\\nThese objectives should be delivered through the preparation and implementation\\nof plans and the application of the policies in this Framework; they are not criteria\\nagainst which every decision can or should be judged. Planning policies and\\ndecisions should play an active role in guiding development towards sustainable\\nsolutions, but in doing so should take local circumstances into account, to reflect\\nthe character, needs and opportunities of each area.\\n\\n10.\\nSo that sustainable development is pursued in a positive way, at the heart of the\\nFramework is a presumption in favour of sustainable development (paragraph\\n11).\\n\\n\\n4 Resolution 42/187 of the United Nations General Assembly.\\n5 Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\",\n",
