      "The Local Plan sets out how we will tackle the existential threat of climate change. It will require all new homes and businesses in Oxford to be net zero-carbon and to operate without using fossil fuels. Resilience to climate important and policies require planting of trees and other green features, as well as flood-resistance measures such as sustainable drainage, in new developments. In addition, policies aim to preserve soil and air quality.\n",

      "Oxford continues to suffer from a housing crisis. The plan identifies sites where 9,612 new homes will be built across Oxford by 2040. Policies allow homes to be built on all employment sites for the first time and encourage of poorly performing or poorly located employment sites to housing. Social housing continues to be prioritised. Within the 40% affordable housing required from larger developments, 80% must be social rent housing (the housing type), with the remaining 20% being other forms of affordable housing, such as ‘shared ownership’.\n",

      "The city should be an attractive and healthy place to live in, work in and visit. Major developers will need to submit a Health Impact Assessment, which sets out the ways the development will promote healthy lifestyles, such as with new walking routes, playing fields or parks. Parking standards keep new car parking spaces to a cycle parking. On top of this, the Local Plan will support and encourage vital community facilities and will continue to protect our district and local centres so that amenities people value and use on a daily basis are within a few minutes walk or cycle of their home.\n",

Some areas do not enable easy and safe access to services and facilities.

There are some barriers to moving around parts of the city, such as watercourses and busy roads.

      "However the physical land constraints mean there is a limited supply of housing in the city, which exacerbates inequalities by leading to high property prices and a limited supply of affordable housing. This is illustrated by the numbers of people waiting on the City Council housing register (2,780 people as at June 2023), and also the house prices: In September 2022 the median house price in Oxford was £445,775, with homes costing 12 times the median salary1, meaning Oxford remains one of the least affordable places to buy in the country. Likewise, median rental prices in Oxford are £1,300 a month as of March 2023, which is significantly higher than the average for the South East of England2. This means that many lower paid essential workers cannot afford to live in the city and then employers experience high staff turnover and vacancy rates which can affect their operation. This is particularly apparent in the city’s schools, hospitals, care homes, public transport services, the building industry, and the universities.\n",

To support this, the Plan also sets out site allocation and Area of Focus policies which will help to give more certainty to communities and landowners about delivery of new homes, and to help ensure that the limited supply of new sites are used as efficiently as possible to help address housing need, with the highest densities directed to the city centre and district centres. The Plan also sets out ambitious policies to tackle the affordability of housing in Oxford; these include policies seeking affordable housing contributions from general housing, student accommodation, and older persons accommodation; as well as continuing the innovative employer-linked affordable housing policy, to enable key employers in Oxford, including the hospitals, to develop affordable housing on their own sites to help meet their staff’s needs.\n",

      "As well as adapting to climate change, it is vital that every effort is made to ensure that new development in Oxford does not further exacerbate the changing climate. Actions which seek to reduce and prevent greenhouse gas emissions (climate change mitigation) will be important for contributing to achieving the UK’s legislated goals of being net zero by 2050 and limiting emissions in the nearer term in line with the sixth carbon budget. It is also essential for meeting the local target of being a net zero city by 2040, which Oxford set for itself in response to the declaration of a climate emergency in 2019.\n",

      "The Local Plan is an important instrument in helping to deliver upon these targets. The strategy that guides the policies seeks to ensure that the way the city changes and grows as new development comes forward does so in a way that is as close to net zero carbon as possible. This means new development is energy efficient and meets all energy needs through renewables so that it does not require retro-fitting in future. It also means that where occupants of existing buildings seek to implement retro-fitting to improve energy efficiency and adaptation to climate change, the planning process is as supportive as possible to enable them to bring such improvements forward. These steps are vital for enabling the city to meet the challenging milestones lain out in the Zero Carbon Oxford Partnership (ZCOP) roadmap to net zero by 2040. Policies in the plan covering density of development, parking levels, reducing the need to travel and support for the provision of necessary infrastructure to achieve this are all important. The Local Plan also demonstrates support for county council policies that seek to deliver net zero targets.\n",

      "Equally, however, the Local Plan is only one tool which will facilitate the shift to a net zero carbon city. Challenges such as the extensive retro-fit need across our building stock, the costs of implementing these, as well as the need for broad-scale upgrades and reinforcement of the energy grid to support wholescale electrification of heat and transport which will all support the implementation of the Plan’s policies will require wider solutions supported by a range of stakeholders and strategies to help address. There will also be an ongoing role for the City Council to work with partners through ZCOP and neighbouring authorities across the county to deliver on other related solutions to net zero that the Local Plan alone cannot fully address. For example, the delivery of new large-scale renewable energy projects will realistically be delivered outside of the city’s administrative boundaries and the city will focus on the smaller-scale renewables that can be accommodated within new developments across the city.\n",
