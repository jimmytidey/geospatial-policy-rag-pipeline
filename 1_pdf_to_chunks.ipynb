Strategic Principles:    a. Realise the benefits of the Borough’s connectivity, international profile and existing and emerging sectoral strengths to secure a supply of land, infrastructure, premises and successful places capable of attracting investment in growth sectors and supporting the existing business base, facilitating the continued diversification of the Borough’s economy and supporting Convergence aims; and    b. Promote employment, industry and logistics as important components of sustainable, mixed use places, whilst recognising the need for this to be strategically managed to ensure premises and places balance the needs of business, visitors, the economy, the environment and Newham’s communities, meet evidenced demand, benefit from Agent of Change principles and as per J2 make efficient use of land.    2. Spatial Strategy:    a. Continued development and promotion of the Arc of Opportunity and employment hubs as (amongst other things) high quality business environments with a diversity of flexible, future-proofed premises with particular strengths as set out in Table 6 below;    b. Focusing visitor attractions, and facilities on Strategic Sites in the Royals Docks and S08, LCY airport and ExCel employment hubs, Stratford Metropolitan and Green Street town centres; and quality visitor accommodation in town centres proportionate to their function and character, together with the Royal Docks Strategic Sites and S08, S31 and ExCel/Royal Victoria West Employment Hubs;    c. Major office development (Use Class B1(a)) will be directed to Stratford, in accordance with Policy S2. Smaller-scale office development will be encouraged in the other Town Centres, LMUAs and MBOAs and on appropriate mixed use Strategic Sites;    d. Major industrial development will be directed to, and where appropriate intensified, (including support for displaced businesses) at Strategic Industrial Locations and Local Industrial Locations (as per Policy J2 and designated in Table 7);    e. New town centre – including night-time and evening economy – uses will be    JobsNewham Local Plan 2018    directed within the defined hierarchy to a centre, including emergent centres on Strategic Sites, proportionate to its scale, unless related to the visitor economy, (as per 2b above), clearly ancillary to other uses, and the NPPF sequential test is met (as per INF5 and SP6); and f. Small-scale start-up and/or cultural and creative workspace will be directed to town centres, (notably Stratford Metropolitan, East Ham, Forest Gate and Green Street), LMUAs and MBOAs, and where appropriate CFOAs (as defined in J2 & INF8) or masterplanned as part of mixed use Strategic Sites, notably at North Woolwich Gateway.    3. Design and Technical Criteria:    a. New employment-generating development should demonstrate, especially when outside of LILs and SILs, that it can exist in close proximity to housing with minimal amenity impact as per SP8;    b. New housing must demonstrate neighbourliness in respect of existing and potential employment uses, LILs, SILs, and existing employment uses in employment hubs or where otherwise expected to prevail, taking on responsibility for protecting those uses from the possibility of future complaint due to the proximity of new residential neighbours;    c. Require new out of centre town centre uses of more than 300 sq m net (sales floorspace) to demonstrate that they do not result in unacceptable impacts as per INF5:3a;    d. New night-time economy uses must demonstrate that they promote a safe and high quality environment for all, cognisant of cumulative impacts set out in Policy SP9; and    e. Require all Strategic Site proposals and major developments incorporating employment floorspace in employment hubs and/or on SIL, LIL, and LMUAs set out in J2, to address Convergence objectives through an Employment Strategy that details:    i. phasing of new permanent employment-generating floorspace in such a way that maximises the likelihood of beneficial use considering deployment of temporary uses where appropriate;    ii. marketing/demand testing and occupier commitments in relation to the proposed mix of unit type, scale and tenure, recognising the identified shortages and surpluses identified by the Newham ELR Part 2 and subsequent updates; and    iii. commitments to work with the Council’s Workplace organisation to maximise local employment opportunities, including appropriate lead-in times in relation to training provision.
