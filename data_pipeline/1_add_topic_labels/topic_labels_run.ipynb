      "The things that residents wished to see improved were all linked thematically – parking, transport, and traffic were easily the most common suggestions.   6.4 If a community believes that it has been involved in and been able to influence the design of a development at an early stage, the higher the likelihood that the development will be considered to be acceptable.\n",

      "Whether a proposed new development is acceptable and appropriate and relates well to its surroundings, is one of the most common judgments to be made, yet historically there is often very little evidence or guidance to assist local people (or decision makers) in making that judgement.   6.6 The government is placing significant importance on the quality of design through the development of design codes which aim to set standards for design upfront and provide firm guidance on how sites should be developed.\n",

      "This includes promoting social interaction, being safe and accessible, and enable and support healthy lifestyles.   Policies should also make provision for shared spaces and community facilities and guard against loss of valued facilities and services.   Local Green Space, including criteria for designation, is dealt with in Paragraphs 101-103.   Achieving well-designed places, in chapter 12, identifies that design considerations include function, adding to the quality of the area, visual attractiveness, effective landscaping, being sympathetic to local character and history, not discouraging innovation and change, maintaining a strong and distinctive sense of place, optimising site potential, and making safe, inclusive and accessible places.   “plans should, at the most appropriate level, set out a clear design vision and expectations, so that applicants have as much certainty as possible about what is likely to be acceptable …   … Neighbourhood Planning groups can play an important role in identifying the special qualities of each area and explaining how this should be reflected in development, both through their own plans and engaging in the production of design policy, guidance and codes by local planning authorities and developers …”.\n",
      "The National Design Guide (2021) establishes that well-designed places have ten characteristics.\n",
      "These are context, nature, identity, use, resources, movement, built form, public space, homes and buildings and lifespan.   The NPPF makes clear in chapter 14 Paragraph 152: “the planning system should support the transition to a low carbon future in a changing climate, taking full account of flood risk and coastal change.”\n",
      "This includes consideration of flood risk, resilience to climate change, and promoting a low carbon economy.   Chapter 15 Conserving and enhancing the natural environment makes clear that planning policies should protect and enhance valued landscapes, intrinsic character and beauty of the landscape, habitats, and provide net gains in biodiversity.   This includes consideration of protection of valued landscapes, intrinsic character, biodiversity net-gain, pollution, and mitigation.   The Local Plan values the natural environment for its many wide-ranging benefits.\n",

      "Additionally such a concentration of traffic causes increased pollution especially around the school gates.\n",
      "Back in 2006 the Parish Plan identified a high level of concern about ‘the inconsiderate and dangerous parking of parents when dropping off/picking up their children from school’.   With a larger school the issue of parking and safety has become even more acute even though the accident rate involving casualties is low.\n",
      "Most pupils live within 0.7 miles of the school, so introducing measures to encourage walking, cycling and scooting to school particularly from Sileby could have a significant impact both on the amount of pollution created as well as be a partial resolution to the traffic issues at school drop off and collection times.\n",
      "On a more positive note, during these key times drivers have to slow/stop in order to allow other vehicles to pass resulting in a reduction in speeding.   The village Memorial car park (owned by the Parish Council) is situated almost opposite the school and is only used by a small number of parents during pick up/drop off times.\n",
      "If parents are to be encouraged to use the car park instead of the street it must be made easier for them to cross Main Street either via a zebra crossing or the appointment of a school crossing/lollipop person.   The County Council Highways department in collaboration with the Parish Council should give priority consideration to undertaking an assessment of these or other safe methods of crossing Main Street.\n",
      "An additional issue for pedestrians walking/scooting to school is the poor visibility for some drivers when exiting from some properties.\n",
      "There are 16 properties along Main Street who have to reverse out of their driveways, which increases the potential for an accident.\n",
      "If the footpaths at the back of the school were to be paved, parents/children on foot could be encouraged to access the school this way thus avoiding Main Street. \n",

      "The Parish area is predominantly agricultural land, mainly owned and farmed by local families, and part of the Green Belt of Cambridge.\n",
      "Enclosed fields to the north and east provide an important rural backdrop for the historic part of the village, while the rising land and dry fields to the south create an expansive setting which embraces the village as a whole, just visible among tall trees.   4.2 The village itself is compact and situated in a tree-rich hollow at the edge of the fen land.\n",
      "It developed from Roman and Saxon times at the junction of winding country roads, which still today shape the village.\n",
      "The historic core has buildings dating from the 14th to 18th centuries, mostly grouped around green spaces at the junctions of the old lanes.\n",
      "The northern-most group is set by the High Street (originally known as Church Street).\n",
      "A second group is located at Pound Green and a third group at Home End (formerly Town Street).   4.3 The 13th century St Vigor’s Church, set in its large churchyard, provides a central focal point adjacent to the manor house.\n",
      "The Six Bells public house on the High Street dates from the 16th century.\n",
      "Along other streets there are several timber framed 14th century farmhouses, and cottages dating from the 16th and 17th centuries with thatched or plain tiled roofs.   4.4 In the 18th century, drainage ditches in the low-lying fenland allowed improved cultivation and increased prosperity.\n",
      "This is evidenced by the construction in the mid-19th century of the Windmill and the Dissenting Meeting House (now the United Reformed Church), paid for by local families.\n",
      "Poor Well and the Horse Pond on Frog End Road (now Cow Lane) are place names referring to the importance of water management in the shaping and fortunes of the village.\n",
      "In the 19th century commercial water extraction to serve the city of Cambridge led to further changes in the land and the construction of the large company building in Cow Lane.\n",
      "The water pumping station closed in 1987 and the water pattern nearby has changed yet again with some lower fields giving rise to new wildlife areas adjacent to Poor Well and the chalk stream arising there.\n",
      "Water patterns in this area are likely to change and be subject to more extreme weather as the climate changes, and rainfall becomes more erratic.   4.5 In the 19th century the school and the almshouses were built in the village, and the Fulbourn Hospital for mental health patients in an isolated position in the countryside.\n",
      "Linear development started to extend northwards along Station Road (previously Hay Street), from the core to the then railway station on the Cambridge/Ipswich line.\n",
      "This gave impetus to industry as goods could be transported to other parts of the country and to the ports.\n",
      "This legacy remains, with industrial premises, such as the mill, and other developments in Station Road which deals internationally and generate significant traffic locally.   4.6 With the building of Council houses in the 1930s, followed by later sequences of housing estates, the village expanded rapidly.\n",
      "These were built adopting the patterns and building forms typical of commercial suburban development and represented a departure from the main character of the village.\n",
      "However, with time, they have acquired some of the local diversity, trees and planting.\n",
      "In 2015 the Swifts replaced the former Windmill Estate (a system built 1960s development) and introduced a new layout, with mixed building types around a green.   4.7 To the west of Fulbourn village and within the Green Belt that separated the village from Cambridge are several buildings of significance.\n",

In determining applications, local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the assets’ importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance. As a minimum the relevant historic environment record should have been consulted and the heritage assets assessed using appropriate expertise where necessary. Where a site on which development is proposed includes, or has the potential to include, heritage assets with archaeological interest, local planning authorities should require developers to submit an appropriate desk-based assessment and, where necessary, a field evaluation. 201. Local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset that may be affected by a proposal (including by development affecting the setting of a heritage asset) taking account of the available evidence and any necessary expertise. They should take this into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise any conflict between the heritage asset’s conservation and any aspect of the proposal. 202. Where there is evidence of deliberate neglect of, or damage to, a heritage asset, the deteriorated state of the heritage asset should not be taken into account in any decision. 203. In determining applications, local planning authorities should take account of:  a) the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation;  b) the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and  c) the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.     204.\n",

      "We very much appreciated hearing from you, about what you thought of the draft policies as they progressed, and we have taken on board your comments.   The Plan’s purpose remains to support the village’s character and community of people and wildlife to survive and thrive in respect of housing and planning development for the needs of the village and wider community.\n",
      "We are working to a vision expressed in section 5.\n",
      "It has been important to us to get our Neighbourhood Plan as right as we can for all residents, businesses, families, walkers, gardeners, land managers and devoted community members so that it serves you and the people of Walsham le Willows as a whole.\n",
      "We have used your feedback to make sure we can do that as it is a living community led plan that speaks up for your rights in local planning law.   We have so many people to thank for the many layers and levels of contribution, from the 200 people who joined events and the mailing list in the early days, to all those who attended the Housing Exhibition, kept up with us on the website, or through the Observer and took time to fill in questionnaires.\n",
      "Our gratitude to the Parish Council for their steadfast support, time and guidance.\n",
      "Thank you also to Ian and all the team who deliver the Observer, Kevin for taking care of the Neighbourhood Plan website and form filling and to all those who have helped us with the mapping, photographs, historical and architectural references.\n",
      "Now we are at the end of the process, we are confident that this document fits neatly alongside a great many other important contributions towards community life and can never be definitive when there are so many small acts of kindness and consideration that happen every day.   Looking back, developing the Plan with the local community during the Covid-19 measures was a challenge.\n",

      "We produced the draft document with their help and then sought your views; you very kindly took the time to read it and comment on it.   There is still much that can change in local and national planning legislation and while we can review it every 5 years, this plan is looking forward 15 years into the future.\n",
      "Who knows what life will be like then?\n",
      "Our hope is that what we have done will be flexible enough to plan and adapt to change and be clear and well researched enough to legally protect and safeguard all that we love and cherish in Walsham le Willows.

      "In the case of Alfold, at the time of preparation of the Plan, the situation in respect of planning and development in the Parish has been subject to recent and very radical change, which has been outside the control of the Parish.\n",
      "Therefore, this Plan has been prepared using the latest data to respond to the significant challenges the local community faces in trying to achieve what national policy requires - Sustainable development.   1.3 The impact of building 4471 new houses in an existing small and scattered rural community previously numbering some 449 households, cannot be over-stated.\n",
      "This is the reality facing Alfold in 2022.\n",

      "The level of development now underway has been permitted with no material improvement in physical infrastructure (roads, schools, health centres etc.) to date to mitigate this situation.\n",
      "This Plan therefore aims to redress the imbalance this has created.   1.4 The challenge addressed in this Neighbourhood Plan is how to manage such change in ways that are sustainable, provide for positive long term outcomes for local residents of all ages and in a wide spectrum of social and economic circumstances.\n",
      "Our priorities, summed up in the Vision below, are not just to maintain and protect the rural nature of the Parish and its way of life, but also to ensure that development, when it happens, makes a positive contribution to the wellbeing of everyone living and working in Alfold.   1 See ‘Housing’ (section 5 of the Neighbourhood Plan) and Appendix D Reg.14 Consultation Version \n",

      "text:   2.6 Notable former residents of Acton include William Jennens, who was known as   William the Miser and the Acton Miser.\n",
      "Jennens made his money through business in London, loaning money to gamblers.\n",
      "He was Britain's richest man at the time of his death in 1798, but aged 97, he had outlived the nominated executors and beneficiaries under his will.\n",
      "The later case of Jennens v Jennens formed part of the inspiration for the Jarndyce and Jarndyce case at the centre of the plot of Bleak House by Charles Dickens.   2.7 Two notable buildings in the parish’s history are Acton Hall and Acton Place.\n",
      "Acton Place was a great house with parkland located to the west of Bull Lane, which, in 1674 was listed as having 20-29 hearths.\n",
      "1 It was bought by Robert Jennens, William’s father, in the early 1700s, who began to rebuild it as a mansion house.\n",
      "It remained unfinished at his death and was finished by William.\n",
      "Whilst the house was demolished in 1960, historical records indicate that it comprised a substantial building and included a servants' wing nine bays wide with a central three-bay pediment.\n",
      "The house was red brick with a two-storey hipped roof.\n",
      "The centre of the house, according to a painting of the 18th century, was eleven bays wide and four storeys high with a three-bay pediment and a hipped roof.\n",
      "It was connected with the wings by single storey quadrant arcades.\n",
      "Some vestiges of the walls or garden walls are still intact.   2.8 Acton Hall,2 located east of Bull Lane and north of the church, was accompanied by an elliptical moat in the shape of a horseshoe and was owned by the de Bures family from 1311, the Lordship of the Manor of Acton having been granted to Sir Robert de Bures under King Edward II.\n",
      "The site of Acton Hall is now occupied by a more modern farmhouse and gardens.\n",
      "Very little is known about the original structure of the hall itself, but records of life within the hall in the early 15th century have survived.\n",
      "The day book of household accounts compiled by Dame Alice de Bryene3 of Acton, descendent of Robert de Bures and widow of Guy de Bryene, details her management of the household for a year over 1412-13, and is regarded as an important social history source.\n",
      "The house ceased to be the home of the Lord of the Manor in the mid-15th century.   1 https://heritage.suffolk.gov.uk/monument/MSF14583 2 https://heritage.suffolk.gov.uk/monument/MSF746   Figure 4: Map from 1896 showing Acton Place and Acton Hall—Reproduced by kind permission of the National Library of Scotland   2.9 Another Acton resident, Catherine Foster, was the last woman to be hanged at Bury St Edmunds in 1847.\n",
      "At the age of 17, she poisoned her husband, John Foster, by putting arsenic in his dumplings.\n",
      "The propriety of this case was discussed in the House of Lords and reported in Hansard.\n",
      "Ronald Blythe, writer, essayist and editor, best known for his work Akenfield: Portrait of an English Village, was born in the village.   2.10 During World War II, land to the south-east of the parish and parts of neighbouring Great Waldingfield parish were used as an airfield.\n",
      "An existing farmhouse known as Gad’s Lane Farm was demolished and the airfield established.\n",
      "At its height, the area included temporary accommodation for some 3,000 men.\n",
      "The first group operating there was in late March 1944.\n",
      "The airfield was built to Class A specifications for American bomber aircraft and was provided with three concrete runways with fifty hardstanding and two aircraft hangars (Type T2).\n",
      "Temporary barrack accommodation was dispersed to the east away from the main flying field around the village of Great Waldingfield.\n",
      "Today, the area has reverted to agriculture with some hardstanding remaining.   2.11 The majority of settlement in Acton parish dates from the 20th century with significant residential development taking place from 1950 onwards.\n",
      "Much of this post war development was undertaken by Melford Rural District Council built to house some of the many homeless people who were squatting in the former army huts at Acton Place 40 dwellings were built at Queensway, believed locally to have been completed in 1954 not long after the coronation, hence the name.\n",
      "Developments on Barrow Hill (23 dwellings) and Vicarage Road (6 dwellings) were built around the same time and were followed by developments such as Coblers Way (29 dwellings) and Gotsfield Close (25 dwellings) during the 1960s.\n",

      "text:   5.1 Policy SP2 of the Waverley Local Plan (LPP1) establishes a spatial strategy for future growth across the Borough as a whole and notes that to meet development needs in a sustainable manner, whilst maintaining the character of the Borough, a limited level of development will be accommodated in and around Alfold.\n",
      "This is expanded upon in Policy ALH1 which establishes a minimum housing requirement for Alfold Parish of 125 new homes (not including Dunsfold Aerodrome) over the period 2017 to 2032.   5.2 Since LPP1 was adopted a large number of sites have come forward in the Parish, including those subject to appeal, and which have either been built, are under construction or now have planning permission.\n",
      "These sites (the largest of which are mapped in Figure 2) will deliver 447 new homes (details of which are found in Appendix D), more than 3.5 times the housing requirement in the Local Plan (125 units).   5.3 This quantum of change (which doubles the existing housing stock), but without any significant increase in key physical infrastructure such as roads, shops, schools and medical centres, poses a new challenge to managing sustainable development in the Parish.\n",
      "It also poses sustainable transport challenges including the need to improve public transport which are dealt with in chapter 8.   5.4 The minimum housing requirement in LPP1 has been met and significantly exceeded, and therefore the Neighbourhood Plan does not allocate sites for new housing.   5.5 Local residents feel overwhelmingly that local need for new housing has already been met, with 90% saying in the 2022 survey9 that there is ‘no need for more new homes in the Parish in addition to those already given permission’.   9 Residents Survey (July 2022) Q18, see Appendix J   5.6 Planning applications for new homes are still likely to come forward over the period of the Plan.\n",
      "Therefore the housing policies that follow set parameters to ensure that any provision is on a scale and contains a mix of types and sizes that reflect genuine local need, and ensure Alfold remains an attractive and desirable place to live.\n",
      "Proportionate housing development can bring benefits to the community through developers contributing to infrastructure and improvements to local services, whilst additional residents potentially support local businesses and facilities (albeit at the same time putting additional strain on infrastructure that is not sufficiently improved).   5.7 This section of the Neighbourhood Plan thus establishes policies in respect of appropriate locations for new homes, housing type, size and tenure.\n",

      "text:   The right for communities to prepare NPs was established through the Localism Act 2011, which set out the general rules governing their preparation.   A NP forms part of the Statutory Development Plan for the area in which it is prepared.\n",
      "This statutory status means that it must be taken into account when considering planning decisions affecting that area.   A NP is required to meet a set of basic conditions if it is to proceed to referendum.\n",
      "Firstly, it must not breach, and be otherwise compatible with EU obligations, including the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive and European Habitats Directive.\n",
      "Although Britain has formally left the EU, its laws still apply.   It also needs to be in general conformity with the strategic policies contained in the development plan.\n",
      "In the case of Cossington, this is the Charnwood LP.   A NP must also have regard to national planning policy and advice.\n",
      "The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2019 sets out the Government's planning policies for England and how these are expected to be applied.\n",
      "The NPPF requires the planning system (including NPs) to encourage sustainable development and details three dimensions to that development:   An economic dimension – they should contribute to economic development;   A social dimension – they should support strong, vibrant and healthy communities by providing the right supply of housing and creating a high-quality built environment with accessible local services; and An environmental dimension  they should contribute to protecting and enhancing the natural, built and historic environment.   8\n",

The first Winchfield Neighbourhood Plan was adopted in 2017 to help deliver the local community’s aspirations for the period 2015–2032.\n",
      "In 2020 a new Hart District Council Local Plan was adopted and National Planning Guidance changed which directly impacted upon our existing Plan.\n",
      "Winchfield Parish Council therefore decided it was important to update our 2017 Plan.   Our new Plan for the period 2022–2037 has been produced by local volunteers, with the support of, and on behalf of, the Parish Council.\n",
      "The Neighbourhood Plan Committee has consulted with the community, residents, landowners and businesses, regarding the sustainability and long-term development of our rural community.\n",
      "Our Plan has the golden thread of Climate Change awareness running through it as we work with and fully support Hart District Council’s Declaration of Climate Emergency and its objectives to achieve Climate Change goals.   Community engagement began in July 2020 and five public meetings were held in the Village Hall, each one advertised on the Parish Council website, in Contact magazine and by a leaflet drop to every property in the village.\n",
      "The Plan evolved over the following months, resulting in the production of this document which reflects the views and wishes of Winchfield residents.\n",
      "This Plan has completed the process through two public consultations and Independent Examination.\n",
      "The Inspector’s recommended modifications were accepted by the Parish Council and Hart District Council and the plan proceeded to Referendum.\n",
      "On 23rd November 2023, with a 44% turnout of residents, 91% voted in favour.\n",
      "As a result, the Plan legally became part of the Development Plan for Hart to be used in the decision making process for planning applications in Winchfield.\n",
      "The plan was ‘made’ by HDC in January 2024.   The Parish Council would like to thank the members of the Winchfield Neighbourhood Plan Working Group and all the volunteers from the village and surrounding areas who have contributed their time, knowledge, expertise and photographic skills to produce this new Neighbourhood Plan. \n",

      "This should not just be through the Neighbourhood Plan but also at individual application level ideally at Pre-Application or inception stage where developers are strongly encouraged to undertake a ‘masterplan style’ approach to influencing proposals.   7.16 Responses to the question of new housing in the Parish – how much and where it should go – have been broadly consistent across the various surveys.\n",
      "There has been a general acceptance from some, that new housing will continue in the Parish, but concerns have been consistently raised over scale, density, design, parking, impact on the village centre of traffic generated from new development, flooding and also the impact on village services and infrastructure.\n",
      "Concerns over ribbon development encroaching into the countryside is a key concern and there is a clear steer that developments of a small scale - up to 5 dwellings - are more likely to be considered to be acceptable.\n",
      "The recent Neighbourhood Plan Household Survey results also revealed that there is still a relatively strong feeling within the community that the current proposed level of new housing as identified in the emerging Local Plan allocations is enough.   7.17 In terms of the location of future housing, the Household Survey did not reveal a preferred location or consensus for new growth although it was clear that new development should be located sensitively to try to minimise the need for traffic to travel through the centre of the village and the historic core.   7.18 Over the last 30-40 years there has been significant housing growth in the village.\n",
      "Notably much of this has been on large development sites.\n",

      "Developments of this scale can have considerable impacts upon their immediate environments but also the settlement as a whole in terms of traffic generation and routing, landscape and nature conservation impacts, and those relating to the historic environment and community infrastructure.   7.19 One of the key determinants of whether any new development is considered to be successful is defining whether it is considered to integrate well with the immediate and wider community.\n",
      "This is even more important for larger developments where the impacts are likely to be more widely felt.\n",
      "If a community believes that it has been involved in and been able to influence the location and design of a development at an early stage, the higher the likelihood that the development will be considered to be acceptable.\n",
      "It is   7.20 As mentioned earlier, it is recognised that there will continue to be applications submitted for development on sites within the settlement boundaries, for small groups of dwellings, for single infill plots or other developments (barn conversions, changes of use etc.) within the Parish.\n",
      "This Neighbourhood Plan seeks to direct new housing development to within the identified settlement boundaries.\n",
      "Where sites over 5 dwellings are proposed, developers are strongly encouraged to include the community at an early stage when proposals are being developed.   7.21 In order to be considered by the local community to be successful, proposals for new housing development would need to be small scale, suitably located within the defined settlement boundaries and be able demonstrate that there would not be adverse effects upon highway safety, heritage or the natural environment.\n",

      "The Huntingdonshire Local Plan through Policy LP 18 identifies the Black Horse Business Park and Brookside Industrial Estate as Established Employment Areas; these are shown on the extract from the Local Plan Policies Map below.  6.5.2 Policy LP 18 of the Local Plan identifies that proposals for'B' class which are B2 (General Industrial), B8 (Storage & Distribution) uses will be supported within Established Employment Areas and on land immediately adjoining them where it can be successfully integrated with the existing site.\n",

      "text:   It is considered that Policy SP4 provides an adequate basis to develop and consider proposals for small scale affordable housing.\n",
      "In addition, the provisions of the NPPF (paragraph 77) that Local Planning Authorities should support opportunities to bring forward rural exception sites that will provide affordable housing to meet identified local needs and consider whether allowing some market housing on these sites would help to facilitate this.\n",
      "This would seem to provide a basis for meeting future housing requirements without the need for large-scale allocations.   In addition to the Local Plan policies considered in detail above, the following are acknowledged as part of strategic planning context for this Neighbourhood Plan.\n",
      "These policies will not be duplicated or added to unless there is a need to add local detail (e.g. as is the case for Policy EN1 on Landscape Character).   - SD1: Principles of Sustainable Development - SP1: Spatial Strategy - SP5: Development in the Open Countryside - H5: Gypsies and Travellers - H6: Travelling Show people - SP6: Community Services and Facilities - E7: Rural Economy - E9: Visitor Economy - EN1: Landscape Character - EN2: Protecting Bio (and Geo) diversity - EN6: The Historic Environment - OS1: Open Space - RE1: Renewable Energy Generation - ID3: Broadband and Communication  1.10 Local Plan Review     The Inspector's final report on the current Local Plan committed the Council to undertake an early review from April 2020 with submission by the end of December 2023.\n",
      "The review enables necessary updates of evidence, and the Council to consider whether its local housing need has changed and needs to be re-evaluated taking into consideration changes to national planning guidance.\n",
      "The timetable anticipates examination in December 2023 and adoption in December 2024.\n",
      "Until then, when the new plan is found sound and adopted, the current Local Plan will continue to be the Development Plan, used to determine planning applications.\n",
      "It will cover housing, economy, retail and town centres, infrastructure and environment.\n",
      "As well as allocating sites, it will include development management policies.\n",
      "There is an ongoing Call for Sites which will be monitored to see if any sites are put forward in Corby Glen.\n",
      "It will be necessary for this Neighbourhood Plan to be prepared to be in conformity with the current Local Plan, but it may also take account of emerging trends or policies in the new Local Plan.   That said, there is a strong argument to be made that, because around 290 new houses are committed in Corby Glen (a 66% increase on the 2011 dwelling stock of 440) , the new Local Plan should not commit more (large scale) housing to Corby Glen.\n",
      "Such an argument will be based on the physical and social capacity of the settlement and the need for a reasonable period of time for the new development to become physically and socially integrated.\n",
      "Thus, it is intended that this Neighbourhood Plan will contain policies that support future small-scale developments in Corby Glen, but not large-scale housing expansion.\n",
      "The view of the Steering Group is that it cannot support further large-scale developments* unless it is clear (through local discussions between SKDC, the Parish Council and village residents) that, despite the recent substantial housing allocation, there remains sufficient physical and social capacity for the expansion to be absorbed.\n",
      "The process of developing Neighbourhood Plan policies along these lines will inform comments from the Parish Council on the Draft Local Plan, when it is issued and, if necessary, to enable it to participate in Local Plan Inquiry/Examination.   (*i.e. usually expected to be not more than 11 dwellings, reflecting the Local Plan interpretation of “limited infill development” in Policy SP3 and Para 2.11). \n",
