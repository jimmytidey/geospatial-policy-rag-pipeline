Institute of Lighting Engineers (IoLE)  Is a United Kingdom and Ireland professional engineering institution founded in 1924 as the Association of Public Lighting Engineers, later known as the Institution of Lighting Engineers, and taking its present name in 2010.    Listed Building  Buildings which are identified as having special architectural or historic importance and therefore are protected from demolition or inappropriate alteration or development by legislation and planning policies. Protection also applies to certain other structures within the curtilage of Listed Buildings. The categories of listed buildings are:  Grade I - buildings of exceptional interest  Grade II – buildings of special interest.  Grade II* - buildings of more than special interest.    Local Nature Reserve (LNR)  Non-statutory habitats of local significance designated by local authorities where protection and public understanding of nature conservation is encouraged.    Local Plan  A development plan prepared by district and other local planning authorities.    National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)  The NPPF is a single document that sets out the Government’s economic, environmental, and social planning policies for England.

Nitrate Vulnerable Zone  A nitrate vulnerable zone is a conservation designation of the Environment Agency for areas of land that drain into nitrate polluted waters, or waters which could become polluted by nitrates.    Neighbourhood Development Plan (NDP)  Localism Act 2011 has reformed the planning system to give local people new rights to shape the development of the communities in which they live. A Neighbourhood Development Plan (NDP) will set out the vision for an area and the planning policies for the use and development of land within your Parish or Neighbourhood Area. Plans should focus on guiding development rather than stopping it.    Policy Map  A map which identifies the location and spatial extent of policies and proposals that are set out in the NDP.    Previously Developed Land (PDL)  Land which is or was occupied by a permanent structure, including the curtilage of the developed land and any associated fixed surface infrastructure (excludes mineral workings, agriculture and forestry buildings or other temporary structures, and land that was Previously Developed Land (PDL) but where the remains of permanent structures have blended into the landscape in the process of time. The definition does not include residential gardens, parks recreation grounds or allotments. Also referred to as ‘brownfield’ land.    Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspaces (SANGs)  Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspaces (SANGs) are a group of existing open spaces that are due to undergo enhancements designed to attract more visitors by providing an enjoyable natural environment for recreation as an alternative to the Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area (SPA).    Settlements  Places where people live and sometimes work. They can be small or large depending on how many people live there and how many facilities there are.    Scheduled Monuments  This is an historic building or site that is included in the Schedule of Monuments kept by the Secretary of State & Culture, Media, and Sport.    Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA)  A Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) is an assessment of future housing requirements in an area, which informs the Local Plan’s strategy and housing targets.    Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)  A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is a conservation designation denoting a protected area in the United Kingdom and Isle of Man. SSSI is the basic building block of site-based nature conservation legislation and most other legal nature/geological conservation designations in the United Kingdom are based upon them, including national nature reserves, Ramsar sites, Special Protection Areas, and Special Areas of Conservation.    Special Protection Areas (SPA)  A nature conservation area designated for its bird interest under the European Wildlife Directive (and subject to the assessment procedure set out in the Habitats Directive), to protect internationally important species of birds which live within them.    Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)  An internationally used term to describe high-level environmental assessment as applied to policies, plans and programmes. SEA is a requirement of European law and considers the impact of proposed plans and policies on the environment.    Strategic Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment (SHELAA)  An assessment that identifies housing and economic development sites (that have been submitted to the Council by landowners and organisations) and assesses their development potential, and when they are likely to be developed. The SHELAA looks at whether the Strategic Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment (SHELAA) sites are deliverable (i.e., available, suitable for development, and likely to come forward in a reasonable timescale) and developable. The SHELAA does not allocate sites for development but informs the preparation of the documents that do.    Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD)  A document which adds further detail to the policies in the development plan. SPDs can be used to provide further guidance for development on specific sites, or on particular issues, such as design. They are capable of being a material consideration in planning decisions but are not part of the development plan.    Sustainability Appraisal (including Environmental Appraisal)  An appraisal of the economic, environmental, and social effects of a plan from the outset of the preparation process to allow decisions to be made that accord with sustainable development.    Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area (TBH SPA)  The Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area (TBH SPA) is a network of heathland sites that provides a habitat for important ground-nesting bird species.

The SHELAA looks at whether the Strategic Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment (SHELAA) sites are deliverable (i.e., available, suitable for development, and likely to come forward in a reasonable timescale) and developable. The SHELAA does not allocate sites for development but informs the preparation of the documents that do.    Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD)  A document which adds further detail to the policies in the development plan. SPDs can be used to provide further guidance for development on specific sites, or on particular issues, such as design. They are capable of being a material consideration in planning decisions but are not part of the development plan.    Sustainability Appraisal (including Environmental Appraisal)  An appraisal of the economic, environmental, and social effects of a plan from the outset of the preparation process to allow decisions to be made that accord with sustainable development.
