      "text:     There’s a wide choice of shops on my doorstep, great bars and restaurants and all sorts of events throughout the year. I used to go to Oxford Street and the West End, but now I don’t need to.  I feel like Newham used to get a lot of bad press, particularly in terms of housing. But these days people move here from all over London, including those who are coming back to where they grew up. I’m proud to say I live in Newham.    I live in the north of the borough, and all the stuff going on in the south seemed so far away from me. But now transport links have been improved, everything seems so much closer. I’ve just got a job in one of the new offices with the help of Workspace travelling to work is easy. The new development in the area has been great for my business. The town centre now has an environment to match its stylish shops and more places people want to visit, stay for longer and spend more. It’s allowed me to improve my shopfront and renovate our home.  I recently downsized. Luckily, I didn’t have to move far, so I’m still close to friends and family. My new home was wheelchair accessible so I didn’t have to make any adjustments. I can easily move around outside too – there are now lifts at every station and less clutter, traffic and pollution on the streets.    You can really see the benefits of the investment in making it easier and more pleasant to walk and cycle. I used to drive to work, but now I cycle. I’m fitter and the air quality seems to be improving. I’m doing my A levels at a local college. It has great links to big and small local employers to help give me the relevant experience needed to get a job. I’m ambitious but also want to stay close to my family. The fact that I can easily access work and save to buy my own home in the local area is very important to me.  We don’t need our own car anymore; our garage is now a play space for the kids and we’ve turned the front garden back into a garden.   \n",

      "text:     Our toilet is flushed with rainwater and the sun makes the lights work. My school has a playground up high on the roof and on the way home I can go to three parks with different things in them.  What’s great is the choice, there’s something for everyone. Whether you’re talking homes, jobs, entertainment or sport, I like that there’s something different to do and see in every direction and you’re always meeting different people and learning new things.  There is so much on our doorstep. It’s amazing to have a park that links to Stratford and Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park all the way down to the Royal Docks and Thames, with loads of interesting things to see on the way. There are iconic buildings old and new, wildlife, and plenty of things for the kids to enjoy.    I’ve been told this area was a barren wasteland until ten years ago. Now it’s turning into a piece of city bit by bit, with everything you need including a new town centre, parks and station. I feel like its finall a place in its own right as well as part of something bigger.  I am opening our new manufacturing plant in the Royal Docks. Our investors can see it has accessibility, connectivity, and is part of a growing cluster of similar businesses, services, higher education and research that will make it a success.      My son’s school is nearby and provides a great environment for him to fulfil his potential. I can also get support at the local community centre, which shares a building with the GP and library – all really modern and inviting.    Having a fast, reliable and well designed bus network is a great help for me going about my day. It makes it easier for me to drop my toddler off at nursery, get to work, do my shopping, get to college in the evening and go to parks and events at the weekend.      Our small firm provides services across london so it made perfect sense to take advantage of Crossrail, more affordable rent and new business space and move to the edge of the town centre. We’ve cut back on the number of vans we use, while our business has grown.  All this space between here and the North Circular used to be totally inaccessible, now it’s like we’ve got a giant back garden to enjoy.   \n",

The greatest opportunities for change will come forward within the Arc of Opportunity which will be the primary focus for new job creation, infrastructure development, new town and local centres, carefully located tall buildings at public transport nodes, and the vast majority of new housing on large sites in Beckton, the Royal Docks, Canning Town and Custom House, West Ham and Stratford, reconnecting residents with the rivers and docks;  b. Urban Newham will see more incremental and smaller scale change in a ‘Web of Opportunity’ focused on Town and Local Centres and Crossrail stations, but will benefit from new development in the Arc and elsewhere through investment and improved connectivity within the Borough (notably north-south), and beyond (notably across the Thames and across London), and comparable attention to design quality, including carefully placed taller buildings, with wider neighbourhoods strengthened according to their particular character, assets and opportunities, making creative use of small spaces, redevelopment opportunities and retrofitting;  c. Successful mixed use areas will emerge and be sustained, notably in town centres, LMUAs and on Strategic Sites, and at a smaller scale particularly associated with social infrastructure investment;  d. A major but managed shift from traditional industrial activity will be achieved on Strategic Sites and LMUAs and more broadly along the Lower Lea Valley and in the Royal Docks Enterprise Zone towards employment uses in emerging growth sectors such as high technology and creative industries, night-time, visitor, retail, leisure and cultural economy, business and financial services, making best use of heritage and other assets in the area;  e. Heavier industrial uses, warehouses and utilities will continue to be concentrated, but will evolve and intensify in the Strategic Industrial Locations (SIL) in Beckton, Thameside East and West and Cody Road and smaller, locally significant industrial areas (LILs) elsewhere, supported by appropriate environmental enhancements, buffering, and active but consolidated wharves;  f. Whilst utilities infrastructure including transport depots, ferry access, sewage works and electricity pylons will continue to be present supporting growth and investment, its spatial impact will be minimised to help secure compatibility with other uses as these come closer; new utilities infrastructure will be particularly related to the requirements of modern sustainable living and environmental resilience;  g. Focused, vibrant, accessible and multi-functional Town and Local Centres will be strengthened according to their particular character, assets and opportunities as vital hearts to local neighbourhoods, with a clear hierarchy evident in function and form, from the Metropolitan Centre of Stratford, through to Major Centres at East Ham, Beckton Riverside and Canning Town, and District Centres at Green Street, Forest Gate and East Beckton, and local centres at other key transport nodes;   \n",

      "text:   1.1 Newham has a vital role in the continuing development of London as a World City.\n",
      "It is a vibrant, dynamic and ambitious Borough that seeks to continue to maximise the opportunities for transformation and regeneration catalysed through the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, wider sub-regional growth and other work by public agencies, and derived from excellent transport connections, a wealth of development land, established and emerging growth sectors, and a young, diverse and increasingly skilled population.   Overall, the Local Plan seeks to deliver 43,000 homes and 39,000 to 60,000 jobs between 2018 and 2033, as part of a series of new, genuinely mixed use places acting as a series of beacons across the whole area, woven into a fabric of equivalent quality and diversity.   1.2 This vision relates to the need to tackle the legacy of Newham’s historic position in London whereby in being outside the more restrictive city boundaries, it became the disproportionatelyfavoured location for dirty, malodorous and noisy industry and infrastructure, and in turn suffered significantly from the demise of the docks and decline of certain traditional industries, and poorly designed social housing estates.\n",
      "While access to a wide range of infrastructure and employment uses is acknowledged as an engine for growth that the Local Plan seeks to reinforce, achieving transformational change requires significant improvements in the quality of design and overall offer of development, including a more balanced mix of uses, greater attention to local as well as strategic needs, better integration between and across sites and neighbourhoods, and more consideration of opportunity costs and externalities as well as benefits.\n",
      "In some cases this is about new types and forms of development; in others, however, it is about providing adequate protection for industry and logistics (some of London-wide significance) and opportunities to work locally, breathing and social spaces and the settings of places and particular assets.   1.3 Successful place-making and the creation and sustenance of sustainable communities in Newham, therefore, require careful management of development: optimising it in relation to strengths and opportunities – ranging from large scale vacant sites to small scale infill/ intensification and transition – rather than maximising it or pursuing singular agendas.\n",
      "This means pursuing quality, diversity and inclusivity not just quantity; long term sustainability as well as short term gains; balance in the provision of [types of] homes, jobs and physical, social and green infrastructure, addressing deficits as well as new needs arising; and ensuring investment in the Arc of Opportunity (the Arc) and the Web of Opportunity (the Web) provides opportunities for all of Newham’s residents.\n",
      "Optimising development also means addressing the factors that have more traditionally meant Newham has been a ‘port of entry’ that people quickly move on from, (e.g. lack of housing choice, or quality schools) as well as new quality of life impacts arising from the scale and pace of development, together with issues relating to demographic and economic change in Newham and elsewhere.\n",
      "The latter includes for instance, an increase in older people requiring different types of housing; rising housing costs generating affordable housing needs; and continued relatively cheap rents drawing in disproportionate demand for certain types of space from outside of Newham which needs to be balanced against local need.   1.4 In turn, these considerations are important components of the Convergence and Resilience agendas pursued by the Council (and Growth Boroughs in the case of Convergence).\n",
      "This is about acknowledging the gaps in outcomes such as health and life expectancy within Newham and between Newham and boroughs further west, tackling causes and ensuring residents and businesses build resilience so they can weather more challenging times personally and through being part of a cohesive community and support networks.\n",
      "Population stability furthers this by ensuring that public and private investment in people is retained locally and generates local benefits, and by helping to foster strong local networks that pervade.\n",
      "Similarly, planning for mixed and balanced communities and diversity of economic opportunity makes for more resilient neighbourhoods and places, as it spreads risk and reduces vulnerability, making it less likely that they will suffer spirals of decline.   1.6 Of additional over-arching significance is the need for comprehensive development and masterplanning, particularly of large scale Strategic Sites in order to help them achieve multiple objectives, but also where several sites/interventions/developments in close proximity need to work together to achieve desired outcomes, and more broadly to support integration of new and existing development, and neighbourliness which becomes evermore important as competition for land increases and uses must necessarily co-exist closer together. \n",

      "In doing so, and in interacting with the strategic principles, it also recognises that the relative scale of opportunity in the Arc is such that, as well as meeting needs arising from new growth, development there (often across several Strategic Sites which act in concert across community neighbourhood and borough boundaries) will have an important role in addressing existing deficits in Urban Newham, a role requiring further attention to connection/barriers between Urban Newham and the Arc.   1.6 Of additional over-arching significance is the need for comprehensive development and masterplanning, particularly of large scale Strategic Sites in order to help them achieve multiple objectives, but also where several sites/interventions/developments in close proximity need to work together to achieve desired outcomes, and more broadly to support integration of new and existing development, and neighbourliness which becomes evermore important as competition for land increases and uses must necessarily co-exist closer together. \n",

      "text:   1.7 This policy sets out the over-arching vision for the Borough, explaining the Key Diagram and providing the strategic framework that other policies cascade from and connect into.\n",
      "Policies S2-6 set out how the Strategic Principles and Spatial Strategy will be delivered at the community neighbourhood level, including phasing.\n",
      "Policies S2-6 therefore set out the Strategic Sites and other local designations which will make a contribution to the delivery of housing, jobs, services and infrastructure within each areas, building on thematic spatial policies and other thematic criteria set out in policies SP1-9, J1-3, H1-4, SC1-5 and INF1-9, which should be referred to for more implementation detail.\n",
      "Whilst an approximate housing delivery has been calculated in accordance with methods described in the accompanying text of policy H1, it is acknowledged that evolving development opportunities mean that delivery may well far exceed the current estimates, in which case infrastructure requirements will need to be re-visited in discussion with the Council.   1.8 In order to enable development of Strategic Sites and the Arc more generally, the Council will proactively engage with Duty to Cooperate partners and other stakeholders, including infrastructure and utility providers, developers and private landowners, and interested community groups, to remove barriers to delivery.\n",
      "This will include investigating a variety of means of funding and otherwise supporting infrastructure and other development-enabling interventions, (e.g. land assembly, decontamination, decking and undergrounding), ensuring that these occur prior to development occurring, or in a way that adequately future proofs.   1.9 Masterplanning is expected on all Strategic Sites and other more sizable windfall sites, notably those proposing multiple blocks/development platforms and a mix of uses.\n",
      "This will need to ensure no harmful impact on the living conditions of both existing and proposed residential occupiers and on the [multi-]functionality of new and existing spaces, (including workspaces and public open space) and secure integration of building heights, housing types, (including housing to meet the specialised needs of local residents) and tenures, safe and convenient sustainable transport access, town and local centres and community facilities, green infrastructure, (including biodiversity net gain) as well as between the site and the wider area.\n",
      "Such masterplanning should be the subject of early engagement with the public and other technical stakeholders, as well as consultation on different iterations as details are established.\n",
      "The Council’s Statement of Community Involvement will be a relevant consideration in formulating a consultation strategy.\n",
      "Through this process it will also be expected that appropriate and proportionate contributions for individual developments to make to the infrastructure requirements of the scheme as a whole are indicated as per INF9 through an iterative process of capacity testing. \n",

      "text:   1.10 Output monitoring will look at policy use in practice and progress on Key Strategic Sites and headline IDP planning and project milestones achieved via in-house monitoring, given these are vital to achieve the transformation of places in line with the vision.\n",
      "Outcomerelevant principles such as ‘good growth’, and ‘community cohesion’ and ‘resilience’ are more difficult to quantify, though can be assessed through qualitative data gathered through regular Council-commissioned survey questions concerning satisfaction with the area and different aspects of life, the personal ability to ‘bounce back’ and perceptions about the extent people feel comfortable living amidst others who live locally, though these are clearly only partly influenced by planning.\n",
      "Others, such as achieving a more stable community are more easily associated with existing, widely available indicators, and can be compared with other authorities to help measure convergence, though Council Tax records will be used to look more closely at internal churn.   However, it is noted that the delivery of the policy vision and objectives is also reliant on the support of partner public sector agencies, members and residents, as well as the collaboration of private landowners, developers and organisations, and wider market forces will also have a significant impact delivery.\n",
      "As such, continued liaison and discussion to ensure that such stakeholders buy into the vision and strategic principles will be important, pre-empting any problems or seeking to secure early solutions.   Success, particularly regarding convergence will also be reliant on the application of all other thematic and spatial policies, hence monitoring should take place in the round as far as possible. \n",

Strategic Principles:    a. Realise the benefits of the Borough’s connectivity, international profile and existing and emerging sectoral strengths to secure a supply of land, infrastructure, premises and successful places capable of attracting investment in growth sectors and supporting the existing business base, facilitating the continued diversification of the Borough’s economy and supporting Convergence aims; and    b. Promote employment, industry and logistics as important components of sustainable, mixed use places, whilst recognising the need for this to be strategically managed to ensure premises and places balance the needs of business, visitors, the economy, the environment and Newham’s communities, meet evidenced demand, benefit from Agent of Change principles and as per J2 make efficient use of land.    2. Spatial Strategy:    a. Continued development and promotion of the Arc of Opportunity and employment hubs as (amongst other things) high quality business environments with a diversity of flexible, future-proofed premises with particular strengths as set out in Table 6 below;    b. Focusing visitor attractions, and facilities on Strategic Sites in the Royals Docks and S08, LCY airport and ExCel employment hubs, Stratford Metropolitan and Green Street town centres; and quality visitor accommodation in town centres proportionate to their function and character, together with the Royal Docks Strategic Sites and S08, S31 and ExCel/Royal Victoria West Employment Hubs;    c. Major office development (Use Class B1(a)) will be directed to Stratford, in accordance with Policy S2. Smaller-scale office development will be encouraged in the other Town Centres, LMUAs and MBOAs and on appropriate mixed use Strategic Sites;    d. Major industrial development will be directed to, and where appropriate intensified, (including support for displaced businesses) at Strategic Industrial Locations and Local Industrial Locations (as per Policy J2 and designated in Table 7);    e. New town centre – including night-time and evening economy – uses will be    JobsNewham Local Plan 2018    directed within the defined hierarchy to a centre, including emergent centres on Strategic Sites, proportionate to its scale, unless related to the visitor economy, (as per 2b above), clearly ancillary to other uses, and the NPPF sequential test is met (as per INF5 and SP6); and f. Small-scale start-up and/or cultural and creative workspace will be directed to town centres, (notably Stratford Metropolitan, East Ham, Forest Gate and Green Street), LMUAs and MBOAs, and where appropriate CFOAs (as defined in J2 & INF8) or masterplanned as part of mixed use Strategic Sites, notably at North Woolwich Gateway.    3. Design and Technical Criteria:    a. New employment-generating development should demonstrate, especially when outside of LILs and SILs, that it can exist in close proximity to housing with minimal amenity impact as per SP8;    b. New housing must demonstrate neighbourliness in respect of existing and potential employment uses, LILs, SILs, and existing employment uses in employment hubs or where otherwise expected to prevail, taking on responsibility for protecting those uses from the possibility of future complaint due to the proximity of new residential neighbours;    c. Require new out of centre town centre uses of more than 300 sq m net (sales floorspace) to demonstrate that they do not result in unacceptable impacts as per INF5:3a;    d. New night-time economy uses must demonstrate that they promote a safe and high quality environment for all, cognisant of cumulative impacts set out in Policy SP9; and    e. Require all Strategic Site proposals and major developments incorporating employment floorspace in employment hubs and/or on SIL, LIL, and LMUAs set out in J2, to address Convergence objectives through an Employment Strategy that details:    i. phasing of new permanent employment-generating floorspace in such a way that maximises the likelihood of beneficial use considering deployment of temporary uses where appropriate;    ii. marketing/demand testing and occupier commitments in relation to the proposed mix of unit type, scale and tenure, recognising the identified shortages and surpluses identified by the Newham ELR Part 2 and subsequent updates; and    iii. commitments to work with the Council’s Workplace organisation to maximise local employment opportunities, including appropriate lead-in times in relation to training provision.

      "text:   3.1 It is expected that more jobs will be created in Newham, a Borough that has seen increases of a third in the numbers of economically active residents since 2010.\n",
      "It is estimated that during the plan period 39,000-60,000 jobs could be created in Newham, which is the highest of all neighbouring Boroughs with the exception of Tower Hamlets.   3.2 In order to help maximise growth potential and promote sustainable and quality employment that addresses the successful mixed use place, Convergence and Resilience agendas, the policy seeks to attract and retain investment from growth sectors such as culture, creative and visitor and evening economy, education and knowledge-led economy, hi-tech manufacturing, warehousing and logistics, construction and green enterprise, business and business services, building on Newham’s strong platform for economic growth.\n",
      "In doing so, the policy aims to capitalise on its excellent connectivity including with The City, Stratford, Canary Wharf and the West End and beyond, and providing for associated land, premises (including storage/yard space) and infrastructure requirements (including digital, energy, transport, work and social spaces).   3.3 Ensuring that the supply of suitable employment land and premises is appropriately protected and newly provided for to meet emerging growth sectors will be a key component in maximising Newham’s economic strength and future investment, recognising that in the competition for land, this needs to be evidence-led, related to growth needs and not entirely speculative, and to work to achieve efficient use of land without undermining functionality.\n",
      "In this respect for instance, it is noted that independent budget hotel market provision is extensive relative to more luxury and quality assured (more than 2*) premises.\n",
      "Likewise, the Employment Land Review (ELR) Demand Assessment demonstrates that major office floorspace is more than well provided for within the pipeline, and at present is unlikely to be justifiable elsewhere in terms of likely beneficial occupation, though there is a gap in the market for smaller scale, more locally oriented offices.\n",
      "Similarly, whilst there is growth in the cultural and creative sector, and significant displacement pressures from increasingly expensive inner boroughs, its presence in Newham will need to be carefully curated rather than provided purely on the basis that ‘if we build it they will come’.   3.4 In supporting the broad range of employment opportunities, the policy seeks to create high quality business environments that are supported by appropriate associated infrastructure (including digital, energy, social infrastructure and facilities) and delivered to meet the needs and requirements of existing and future businesses and their users.\n",
      "Promotion of diverse and flexible workspace allows response to changing business needs and creates robust, future-proofed places, including successful Town Centres and the promotion of local supply chain and local employment links; indeed, particular need has been identified for micro, social, small and medium enterprises, as well as larger ones, and a variety of ownership, lease and licence terms and prices1.   Newham Employment Land Review Part 2: Demand Assessment   3.5 Although, overall, the Council will be seeking a broad range of employment opportunities, certain types of employment are considered to be more appropriate or likely to succeed in particular areas such as larger evening/night-time uses within Major or Metropolitan town centres, visitor accommodation in town centres or in employment hubs with particular visitor economy roles, cultural and creative in MBOAs and LMUAs, and major Office development in Stratford.\n",
      "This builds on locational advantages including agglomeration effects related to key use clusters, compatibility with the wider area, and the provision of appropriate infrastructure, such as the capacity of the transport network.\n",
      "Recognising significant areas of existing employment and identifying their future potential, the Council has therefore designated a number of Employment Hubs.\n",
      "These are mostly in the Arc of Opportunity, but also relate to other key employers and employment areas in Urban Newham, notably the Town Centres.\n",
      "In these, suitable employment uses will be encouraged, and in some cases protected, where appropriate looking to reinforce their success by new development at key sites just beyond them, as well as within the hubs themselves.\n",
      "Superimposed on this are a number of sector-specific strategies, relating to other policies in the plan, (notably public transport accessibility (INF2) and particular opportunity areas identified in spatial policies) national and London-wide policies.   3.6 Although the majority of employment will be directed to these areas, other locations are likely to be suitable for smaller-scale development, for example in Strategic Sites identified for mixed uses as detailed in Policies S1-6 and other small-scale designations including LMUAs (for cultural/creative workspaces) and LILs (recognising local clusters of industry) as identified in policy J2 (and Table 7). \n",

      "including as well as industrial and other employment, housing, social and green infrastructure, waste, transport and utilities, recognising their interrelationships; for instance that housing growth generates warehousing and logistics needs, and employment growth generates housing need.\n",
      "In doing so, it seeks to optimise opportunities for economic growth in a way that supports a strong local economy (and therefore resilience and convergence) and wider strategic needs, and promotes a quality of place, through a spatial strategy and reservoir of employment land that provides for different types of employment space, with varying locational attributes and compatibility with other uses, and managed, plan-led land use change.   3.15 Newham is a strategically important industrial location for London.\n",
      "It has the balance of infrastructure to enable businesses to adequately service the CAZ with staff able to easily travel by public transport (some to be enhanced through the delivery of Crossrail).\n",
      "In order to assess employment land needs across the borough, the Council have completed an Employment Land Review (ELR).\n",
      "The Review sought to qualitatively audit the existing employment land alongside a commissioned study to objectively assess future demand for employment space over the plan period.   3.16 The Review concludes that industrial development is viable throughout the Borough but there is strong demand for industrial space (including ‘last mile’ uses) across the Borough which is currently not being met.\n",
      "The ELR identifies that the Borough has a demand for at least 26 ha of industrial and warehousing land, (16 ha for warehousing / logistics including depot uses and 9 ha for industry including waste) with further requirements derived from displacement from its Strategic Sites and those elsewhere in inner London (notably Tower Hamlets) and that it has a reservoir of 42.52 ha to meet such need over the plan period, allowing for limited, Managed Release and consolidation of wharves, notably on some Strategic Sites, which are crucial to delivering the Council’s Spatial Vision (see spatial policies).   3.17 Whilst some of this land, and other land formerly in employment use is vacant, only that specifically identified is seen to be ‘surplus’ to requirements, and even this will result in some displacement which will need to be re-accommodated in order to meet needs in the round, and ensure a net increase in employment.\n",
      "Likewise, some employment land is seen to be in relatively low intensity use, but this should not necessarily be regarded as ‘underused’, at least spatially, as in many cases this relates to operational requirements (e.g. yard space for large vehicles) though in some cases there may be scope to intensify its use temporally by introducing further shifts or other uses at certain times of the day (e.g. coach parking).   3.18 Moreover, given the influence of ‘hope value’ for residential development and ongoing displacement issues (including the use of insecure, short-term leases), ‘forward protection’ of presently vacant sites, or sites otherwise with capacity to meet demand is set out.\n",
      "This goes hand-in-hand with proposed Managed Release/Transition and the provision of support to affected businesses no matter the extent of their lease; however there is also acknowledgement of the need for consolidation of industrial uses outside of residential areas to enhance residential environments, given that it is often such small scale uses (e.g. vehicle repair workshops) that lead to most complaints as they have not had appropriate compatibility with residential designed in.   3.20 However, the demand for remaining stock of land will remain acute, with landowners seeking to manage their landholdings in ways that enable them to quickly realise the higher values for their land that redevelopment incorporating residential or particular types of higher grade/higher density employment uses that command greater rents could bring.\n",
      "This has put particular pressure on space extensive uses such as open storage, and more affordable workspace.\n",
      "As with London as a whole, the plan-led Managed Release, Managed Transition and Managed Intensification approach is therefore vital to ensure that the Borough carefully manages its remaining stock and opportunity sites and overall transition to a mixed use borough to best effect.\n",
      "With such pressure on Newham’s industrial land, new development will be expected to demonstrate that employment-generating capacity consistent with the designation/spatial strategy has been maximised, not least through the provision of market relevant space, and that changes do not result in loss of functionality. \n",

      "Similarly, new workspace on other [parts of] Strategic Sites (notably Alpine Way S02, Connaught Riverside S23, North Woolwich Gateway S04, Lyle Park West S20) together with LMUAs, offer the opportunity to alleviate pressure and land demands on core industrial land, from uses or configurations of space that are more compatible with residential and help secure other benefits of a mixed use typology.\n",
      "It is also acknowledged that otherwise unallocated out of town retail parks in Beckton also offer some capacity of type, particularly where uses (e.g. car hire, open storage) may be more compatible with retail servicing and car parking.\n",
      "In turn, MBOAs, LMUAs and Strategic Sites present opportunities to develop smaller scale workspace (such as incubators, accelerators and co-working spaces) to accommodate the Borough’s buoyant levels of start ups or other businesses for whom affordability is an issue, and in residential areas, some very small scale workspace to support existing business needs may be acceptable.   3.20 However, the demand for remaining stock of land will remain acute, with landowners seeking to manage their landholdings in ways that enable them to quickly realise the higher values for their land that redevelopment incorporating residential or particular types of higher grade/higher density employment uses that command greater rents could bring.\n",

      "As per the GLA Land for Industry and Transport SPG, the policy ensures that the site has been adequately marketed through commercial agents at a price that reflects market value for industrial use for a reasonable period, and offered with potential for redevelopment where this is required to meet the needs of modern industrial users.   3.25 In turn, on sites where employment uses are to continue to feature, as per J1, provision should be subject to market and demand testing, including reference to the ELR Demand Side Study and subsequent updates.   3.26 In requiring release sites to achieve Neighbourly Development (as per SP8), the assumption would be that uses to benefit from Agent of Change would be operating reasonably and lawfully, and over time if they in turn propose further development, that this should reflect the potential of modern design and supply chain specification to improve environmental performance and neighbourliness.\n",
      "It is however recognised that some industrial (including modernised) processes are inherently less neighbourly than others, and that one of the reasons for continuing to designate land as SIL is to concentrate these uses to better manage their impacts on overall development capacity.   3.27 In relation to wharves, there are two components of the wharf strategy (policies INF1 and S3/S4).\n",
      "The first seeks the consolidation of four safeguarded wharves in Thameside West (Thames, Sunshine, Manhattan and Peruvian Wharves) on Central Thameside West (Peruvian and Royal Primrose Wharves) through Managed Intensification criteria (and appropriate development of associated Strategic Sites) requiring rationalisation and reduction of spatial impacts without net loss of capacity and functionality.\n",
      "This works with the Managed Release of associated SIL to ensure operational continuity for active wharf users.\n",
      "The second is the release of the two wharves at Canning Town Riverside (Mayer Parry and Priors Wharf) due to surplus capacity in the NE region.\n",
      "The Council will work with its partners including the PLA and GLA to realise this strategy and secure compliance with relevant London Plan policies. \n",

      "Elsewhere (on SIL and LIL more generally) the objective will be to increase capacity for further SIL and LIL compatible uses (without incursion of residential).\n",
      "In all cases it requires careful attention to the need of SIL and LIL uses on site, and how they could be intensified without compromising their operational functionality and overall capacity expectations on sites (relating to modelled demand for industrial and warehousing uses including transport, utilities and waste management) as set out in the Employment Land Review Part 2 (and any subsequent updates) and monitoring updates.   3.29 Such intensification may be achieved over several sites that better meet needs than one site and allow for rationalisation of space perhaps by including a non-traditional employment site (such as an otherwise unallocated out of centre retail park).\n",
      "Another possibility is temporal intensification, making use of ‘down time’ on other sites.\n",
      "Spatially it will also include actions such as enclosure of external storage, reducing off site impacts.\n",
      "Functionality considerations will include continued provision of adequate yard space, road access, ability to accommodate working patterns, wider ability to accommodate projected industrial/warehousing demand, (including a measure of cross-boundary displacement) in some cases due to impacts on adjacent SIL/LIL (e.g. due to potential access routes through the subject site).   3.30 MBOAs are areas of search for micro-business and as such, scale of proposals should reflect definitions of a micro-business and typical employment densities defined by the HCA or successor work.\n",
      "Their operation is intended to complement town centre and Key Corridor policies, recognising that in some locations consolidation of all commercial uses into town centres is challenging, and active ground floor uses and design/quality improvements may be beneficial to the wider street.\n",
      "In doing so, uses should not be of a scale that would cause town centre impacts and should be non-speculative, to avoid the potential for problematic ground floor voids as per SP3.   3.31 Employment-led development is defined on the basis that employment needs (including the viable operation of employment generating uses on the site and where relevant, adjacent sites) should be met first in any design, and then other uses such as residential are fitted around it.\n",
      "This will involve a design and market engagement exercise that establishes the optimum quantum and format of employment space (or in some cases supporting utilities infrastructure) that the site can sustain, and further design to ensure that other elements of the proposal do not prejudice the viable operation of such uses on the site and where relevant, adjacent sites, but also designing-in compatibility with residential and quality place-making.\n",
      "This process should be in conjunction with response to Managed Transition criteria where appropriate.   3.32 In respect of the commentary above, it is worth noting that in some cases B2 and B8 uses and similar Sui Generis Uses will be enabled to prevail on LMUAs through design strategies that better secure their compatibility with residential e.g.\n",
      "enclosure, and higher insulation standards in any residential introduced on site.\n",
      "In some cases, this kind of process may simply be the start of a longer term process of transition compared to elsewhere.   3.33 In order to support existing businesses, this policy also provides for the small-scale intensification of B Class and Sui Generis employment-generating floorspace outside of the employment land hierarchy, and scope for small-scale walk-to facilities to meet the needs of people working within industrial areas.\n",
      "The provision of such facilities should be in line with town centre and community facilities policies (INF5, INF8) which prioritise town and local centre locations for such uses, but allow for small scale local provision where other access is lacking (i.e. within 400-800m, a 5-10 minute walk).\n",
      "Office space should be clearly ancillary to main industrial uses on a SIL or LIL, and in the case of childcare and training facilities, clearly linked to the employment functions.\n",
      "Whilst the scale of ancillary uses is a matter of fact and degree, in line with London Plan SIL Policy, this means that B1a floorspace should not be large-scale, predominate or compromise the wider industrial offer and preferably be necessary to its functioning. \n",

      "text:   4.1 The delivery of quality and varied new homes is essential to meeting Local Plan objectives of providing for local and strategic needs arising from population and economic growth, in turn creating high quality, safe and secure places, with stable, mixed and balanced communities that work.\n",
      "Whilst Newham has a long history of welcoming new communities and benefits from a rich diversity, the high level of in-migration and the relatively cheap rents of East London that attract them have tended to be exploited by landlords who have created small [often sub-standard] flats and [often poor quality, over-crowded] HMOs in former family housing, reducing choice and eroding quality, with many people as a consequence passing through rather than setting down roots.\n",
      "This in turn has further affected community resilience and the extent to which people invest in improving their environment.\n",
      "Choice has also in the past been affected by smaller units dominating new-build supply, and quality by a failure of infrastructure investment to keep pace with growth, or in some cases, by poorly located housing.\n",
      "Quality in supply also becomes increasingly important with rising densities in order to compensate for intensity that comes with meeting housing need.   4.2 Offering choice in housing through new quality supply (including that with specialist adaptations) is therefore vital to securing a successful, stable and inclusive place, ensuring housing supply can meet the differing needs of a diverse population and continue to do so throughout the course of their lives, as circumstances change, thereby reducing the need to move out and encouraging people to stay in the area, reducing churn and generating a resident population who have a strong stake in the borough’s future.\n",
      "This is covered by the various policy interventions including those introduced for Build to Rent accommodation, which as with other tenures, aim to ensure a viable rental offer that encompasses the kind of quality and security that will keep people in their homes, and in Newham for longer.\n",
      "In turn, housing quality in itself and as part of neighbourhoods where people have access to high quality amenities and good transport links due to appropriate infrastructure development, location of housing, and densities commensurate with accessibility, benefits health and well-being and economic development outcomes, supporting Convergence objectives.   4.3 Therefore, whilst with rising land prices there is a tendency by some developers to suggest that housing quality (notably space standards) should be compromised to achieve affordability, or housing numbers and densities should be prioritised over mix or locational considerations, this is not seen to be an appropriate path to take in light of these other objectives.\n",
      "It is noted for instance, that the infrastructure policies / identified infrastructure requirements of the Plan are linked to a projected level of delivery that accounts for these factors.\n",
      "Equally, it follows that, if a site is judged to be suitable for residential, it should be suitable for all families as much as smaller households, as per the existing situation in and around many of the Borough’s town centres.   4.4 Notwithstanding the above, housing numbers are important, and Newham, given its high birth rate and levels of in-migration has a growing local need2, as well as the ability to accommodate strategic need beyond this due to the extent of development sites.\n",
      "The London Plan sets 10 year housing targets for all London boroughs, cognisant of both capacity and Pan-London need, with the aim of targets being met and exceeded between 2015 and 2025.\n",
      "The current target places a ‘general conformity’ commitment on Newham to provide 19,445 homes within this timeframe.\n",
      "However, the period of the Local Plan (2018 – 2033) requires consideration of housing delivery further into the future.   Full Objectively Assessed Need (OAN) 2011 – 2033: 51,800 units.   4.5 Through a range of data sources and taking into account other polices of the Local Plan that require homes to come forward with job creation and supporting infrastructure for quality mixed and balanced communities, the number of homes that may realistically come forward during the Plan period, as well as the timing of delivery has been estimated.\n",
      "Assumptions not only take into account extant permissions, regeneration plans and known activity within the borough, but also attempt to account for projected rates of infrastructure delivery and investment and market interests, as well as factors such as market absorption rates, availability of finance and construction capacity.\n",
      "Delivery of new homes ultimately, however, depends on such macro-economic factors affecting build rates.\n",
      "These will continue to be impacted by economic cycles and the availability of grant and infrastructure funding, both of which will have a profound impact on national house building. \n",

      "These sites, together those with a recent consent for residential development, are required to be built out for conventional housing (at least in part) in order to meet the assumptions set out above, and the associated strategic principle gives a clear statement to the market of this expectation.\n",
      "Conventional residential is in turn specified because this is where greatest need lies, given that infrastructure has been planned in light of projected housing delivery of this type, and because conventional housing is inherently more flexible than other types of housing to meet a broad range of needs, particularly when designed well.\n",

      "text:   4.21 As part of the creation of high quality places that meet local and strategic needs, in turn ensuring stability that encourages people to live, work and stay in Newham, it is essential that the delivery of affordable housing continues to take place alongside that of market accommodation.\n",
      "As with the rest of London, demand for affordable housing is high and Newham already accounts for a large proportion of the future housing supply of London and the sub-region and has considerable needs of its own, both in terms of market and affordable housing need.\n",
      "Newham also has a high proportion of social housing compared with other areas of London.\n",
      "Bearing this in mind, and in the context of aspirations for the creation of mixed and balanced communities, policy seeks to add to the overall strategy by facilitating a range of accommodation that allows people to move between tenures and property size as their household and economic circumstances change.\n",
      "This means attempting to employ the use of a number of genuine affordable housing options, which include social rent, affordable rent and intermediate housing such as low cost home ownership products (see glossary for a definition of terms), to assist working people on low wages into their own home.\n",
      "It is considered that this will help stabilise communities and reduce churn, resulting in improved community cohesion.   4.22 As with all London boroughs, Newham is directed by the London Plan to provide an overall strategic affordable housing target in its Local Plan to meet local and strategic needs, and to seek the maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing when negotiating on individual private residential and mixed use schemes.\n",
      "Evidence points to a maximum strategic target of 50% of homes to be affordable during the plan period, based on Newham’s level of need and scheme viability.\n",
      "However, this level of provision may not be immediately achievable on all sites within Newham, therefore, recognising the variation in land values that already exists in different areas of the borough, as well as the potential for significant growth during the plan period that will impact such values, affordable housing is sought through a negotiation target that ranges between 35 and 50% of total units within a scheme.\n",
      "Within this stipulated range, in accordance with pan-London needs, the tenure split sought by policy is that 60% of units delivered are to be social housing (i.e. social rent or affordable rent or a combination of the two) and 40% are to be intermediate homes.\n",
      "Whilst it is accepted that unique circumstances may mean that some schemes will be unable to provide affordable housing within this range, varying scenarios have been modelled to consider different circumstances (including growth rates) over the entire plan period.\n",
      "Evidence indicates that 50% affordable housing is achievable on some schemes currently and it will become increasingly achievable on a greater number of sites throughout the next 15 years.\n",
      "Moreover, many schemes can achieve at least 35% at present, in some cases due to grant funding or other forms of subsidy including the off-siting of provision.\n",
      "For these reasons, this target range is considered to be robust provided it is applied flexibly on a case by case basis in accordance with policy H1.   4.23 Variation in this split applies to proposals in the Canning Town and Custom House Regeneration Area, where 65% market housing and 35% affordable, evenly divided between social housing and intermediate tenure is sought, due to the existing tenure split, which comprises a relatively high proportion of social housing.\n",
      "This reflects the objective of delivering mixed communities; diversifying this split and increasing the share of market and intermediate housing to improve the housing mix in this area.   4.24 Newham’s Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) shows a substantial requirement for people on the lowest incomes, justifying their need for accommodation at target rents.\n",
      "Newham has a substantial programme of housing estate renewal (e.g. as part of the Canning Town Regeneration Programme) whereby existing social housing tenants will be offered alternative accommodation under similar conditions.\n",
      "This will require a substantial pool of replacement social rented housing units.\n",
      "Moreover, even within the affordable rent tenure there is a need to cater for varying levels of need. \n",

      "Overall, affordable housing delivery will aim to achieve 50% of the total units as affordable within the plan period through a variety of sources, including new private sector developments, local authority developments, schemes funded independently, and vacancies brought back into use.   4.27 For units to be considered to be ‘affordable’ in policy terms, provision must meet the affordable housing definitions set out by the London Plan.\n",
      "Other types of housing, including that where quality (notably space standards) is compromised under the guise of providing cheaper accommodation than the local context, is not an acceptable substitute for genuine affordable housing options required by policy.   4.28 Policy that enables the delivery of affordable housing will be implemented via the development management process, with the negotiation target of between 35% and 50% of total units within a scheme being affordable (with policy compliant tenure splits) applied having regard to the appropriate mix considerations in policy H1.\n",
      "When accounting for local context, this should include consideration of any decant or right to return requirements.\n",
      "A site’s capacity to deliver 10 or more units will be determined through density assumptions calculated using an established methodology in accordance with the SHLAA.\n",
      "Given the 50% affordable housing over the plan period is the strategic target, and site targets are 35-50% of units, this does not preclude 100% affordable housing schemes when justified in relation to mix and tenure considerations.   4.29 Detailed Viability Appraisals are required to accompany all schemes that fall below the maximum affordable housing threshold set out within policy.\n",
      "Such appraisals should provide justification for the level of affordable housing achievable against benchmark land values that rely on an ‘Existing Use Value plus premium’ (EUV+) approach.\n",
      "This allows a landowner to receive at least the value of the land in its pre-permission or lawfully permitted use, with a premium added as an additional incentive to release the site, having regard to site circumstances (which will vary).\n",
      "Premiums above EUV should be justified, reflecting the circumstances of the site, and the LPA will consider the robustness of any assumptions in this regard.\n",
      "The level of premium can be informed by benchmark land values that have been accepted for planning purposes on other comparable sites.   4.30 Appraisals will be scrutinised as part of the application process and information included must be benchmarked against publicly-accessible information, (relevant to the local context) and robustly justified.\n",
      "The viability assessment must allow for independent scrutiny by the LPA (or other determining authorities) and anybody who undertakes a review of the veracity of the submission on behalf of the LPA. When an existing use value of a development site is included within a development appraisal this should be evidenced, including reasonable comparative uses in similar condition and circumstances.\n",
      "Alternative use or the hope value associated with the prospective development of the site should be excluded from the viability assessment.\n",
      "Where the amount paid for a development site exceeds the reasonably assessed residual land value this should not adversely impact on the delivery of sustainable development.\n",
      "Commercial land transactions should not diminish the delivery of a quality policy compliant planning application with relevant supporting infrastructure.\n",
      "Notwithstanding that, the process of scrutiny will take into account guidance set out in the London Borough Development Viability Protocol (Nov 2016).   4.31 In relation to the delivery of build to rent PRS, policy requirements for affordable housing remain the same.\n",
      "Applicants should ensure where PRS is proposed (either as the only housing type on site, or as an element of a broader scheme) that viability appraisals for PRS developments incorporate sensitivity testing that demonstrates the different outcomes of delivering a proportion of the site as PRS vs. delivering more market sale units (as set out in the PAR) reflecting the commercial choice to deliver PRS.\n",
      "Where exceptional circumstances allow for off-site provision or payment in lieu of affordable housing, off-site provision should be delivered before or in line with the PRS element of the proposal, whilst payment should be proportionate and financially neutral.\n",

      "text:   4.34 As discussed in policy H1’s Justification, an overriding concern of the Council is to ensure housing provision that meets a full range of local and strategic needs.\n",
      "At times this means prioritising local requirements against those of pan-London to redress the imbalanced housing supply, stabilising the existing population, building quality sustainable mixed and balanced communities where people choose to live, work and stay.   4.35 The range of housing needs of Newham’s diverse population is varied.\n",
      "A wide and flexible housing offer will help to cater for a broad range of needs throughout the lifetime of a household, including specialist accommodation such as older persons’ housing and facilities that provide support through provision of external care that may allow for ongoing occupation of the original family home.\n",
      "However, it is also recognised that there are circumstances where conventional housing is either not best suited to, or cannot meet the needs of a household or a specific group, thus policy is designed to enable (and in some cases protect) specialist accommodation for inter alia, vulnerable adults, older persons, individuals with support needs, those at risk from violence, and those otherwise requiring refuge, where need can be demonstrated.   4.36 In supporting Local Plan objectives policy provides clear specification for requirements in relation to specialist housing, to ensure that developments of this type do not undermine other core principles of the Plan.\n",
      "This means not only enabling quality accommodation that meets need, but also ensuring that it is in the right spatial location, both for the benefit of occupants in terms of access to transport, facilities and support services, but also in safeguarding the amenity of any surrounding residential development, from nuisance and anti-social behaviour.\n",
      "Moreover, in the context of limited land supply, and relatively cheap land/rents that has encouraged demand for such uses from outside of Newham to manifest here, the policy seeks to ensure that certain forms of specialist and other high occupancy housing, notably nightly-stay hostels for homeless people, specialist private student accommodation and multiple occupancy housing (HMOs, for occupation for groups other than single households), do not impede the delivery of conventional housing, strengthening the ability to achieve the right housing mix.\n",
      "In doing so, it acknowledges the inherent greater flexibility of conventional housing to meet a range of needs if designed appropriately.   4.37 The dispersal of student housing alone without, for instance, wider university campus provision and the associated jobs and economic benefits goes against the grain of the Local Plan’s emphasis on the provision of both jobs and homes.\n",
      "Considering this, accepting that Newham has a strategic role to play in meeting pan-London housing need and recognising the requirement for some purpose-built specialist provision for students attending local institutions, the policy seeks to provide a proportionate delivery of student housing against that of conventional supply, directing it to appropriate locations.\n",
      "In doing so, the policy provides an assessment mechanism for bringing forward this type of accommodation using the mainstream housing target in Policy H1 and comparing this to student housing need; accounts for the actual 5 year delivery and the evolving nature of housing provision in a community neighbourhood and ward area; considers the proportion of local need which it may be appropriate to provide for within specialist accommodation; and prioritises mixed use development bringing jobs and homes.\n",
      "Given fluctuations in delivery on an annual and broader basis, the policy does not set absolute targets, instead providing guidance as to where additional student housing provision may be unbalancing and displacing more flexible conventional housing provision.   4.38 With a generally ageing population across London, the policy also seeks to ensure delivery for the older peoples’ care sector, in accordance with indicative strategic benchmarks set out within table A5.1 of the London Plan, 2016. To add to this, housing in Use Class C2 (residential institutions) is protected in the same way as social infrastructure provision via policy INF8 and London Plan Policy.   4.39 Given rising cost of living, together with Government welfare reform, demand for temporary accommodation (particularly for families that experience homelessness) is on the rise, often being met by bedspaces within nightly stay hostels.\n",

      "These impacts may further be exacerbated when the multiple occupancy is made up of a specific demographic, where for example a similarity of lifestyle or need might result in use of local facilities or public spaces at similar times, or generate demand such that the provision of local facilities becomes skewed towards them (for example, students and the night-time economy).\n",
      "While all housing needs can be accommodated within the Borough, this policy provides the Local Plan’s spatial strategy for specialist accommodation in order to manage such impacts (both positive and negative).   4.41 Town centre locations are most accessible to a range of users.\n",
      "They have better public transport and infrastructure in place to manage large congregations of people, as well as a range of facilities that people need (and can benefit from) in the course of a single trip.\n",
      "Key corridors in their function as public transport routes similarly provide enhanced access to services and supporting facilities and, like town centres, tend already to be busier, livelier locations.\n",

      "In turn, there is also is the opportunity for centres to benefit from the additional spend and investment generated from increased numbers of people.   4.42 The need to consider the location of specialist housing in relation to support services such as sources of employment, training and job search, healthcare (including specialist healthcare) and schools, is vital.\n",
      "Whilst such services should be accessible to all of the Borough’s inhabitants, it may be all the more significant for those with extremely limited access to resources (for whom cost of travel is a barrier) or those with mobility issues (for whom proximity is key).\n",

      "Projected growth in the number of households over the Local Plan period up to 2033 effectively means there should be no (net) reduction in the housing stock, and a key element of the Local Plan is the very clear presumption against the loss of residential floorspace, with particular emphasis on protecting family housing.   4.51 Prior to the introduction of policy resisting the loss of family homes and the Article 4 Direction requiring planning permission for HMO conversions in 2012, dwelling conversions to flats or to houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) saw considerable growth in numbers.\n",
      "From 2001 to 2012 the proportion of flats in a converted dwelling doubled from 8.4% of total stock to 16.8%, whilst the overall proportion of all flats grew by 8%.\n",
      "There are now approximately 51,200 households in private rent (around half of the total housing stock) and a quarter of these are occupied as HMOs.\n",
      "These are evenly distributed throughout the borough, however some ‘hot spots’ are found in Stratford and West Ham, East Ham, Manor Park and Canning Town.\n",
      "Excluding Manor Park and Canning Town, and together with Forest Gate, these areas also have the highest proportions of converted dwellings.   4.52 Whilst large proportions of these previously-converted dwellings are for private rent, which can provide relatively cheap accommodation for residents, (particularly if shared), as many were created from what were originally family-sized dwellings, (i.e. those in the highest demand) this has challenged the wider aspiration to stabilising communities, through the reduction of housing choice.\n",
      "Moreover, concerns remain over the negative changes to the character of neighbourhoods resulting from converted homes that lack quality or are poorly maintained, inclusive of how such accommodation may support increased levels of transience, parking pressure and refuse generation, and the associated impact on the external environment and amenity.   4.53 It is very clear from analysis of requirements that Newham will fail to provide enough family housing if it does not both increase the rate of new provision (as per H1) and hold onto existing family stock.\n",
      "On this basis the policy largely resists new conversions and seeks where possible to support de-conversion.\n",
      "It is considered that there is sufficient capacity for flats and HMOs through purpose-built new build, conversion of non-residential uses, and reuse of redundant premises above shops in Town Centres.   4.54 Notwithstanding the above considerations regarding the protection of family homes, it is acknowledged that in some circumstances, subdivision or conversion can have multiple benefits or more desirable outcomes than the status quo.\n",
      "To address this, policy includes a criteria based policy clause that would allow subdivision or conversion of existing units in specified circumstances, in turn helping to uplift often underutilised or substandard accommodation in locations that have often suffered from historical issues with housing quality and where intensification is appropriate.   4.55 Additionally, the need for 4 bedrooms homes, whilst modest compared to other housing sizes is not insubstantial, thus any existing large units (4 bed plus) should continue to be protected as part of ensuring a broad market offer, especially as units of this size are rarely proposed as part scheme mix within new developments.\n",
      "It is however recognised that some 4 bed plus units may either be large enough or designed in such a way that conversion or subdivision could still enable the supply of other large family units, more aligned with demand, and may help support viable conservation work in large Conservation Area properties.\n",
      "Policy therefore allows for such conversions provided that adequate amenity space, suitable for family use, is safeguarded to mimic the typical provision for a family home in Urban Newham, maintain character, and avoid the over-extension of houses into gardens being a justification for conversion. \n",

      "While growth and change is recognised as necessary and in many respects beneficial, development should avoid and minimise harm to the environment, incorporating mitigation where necessary and delivering improvements wherever possible.\n",
      "By the same token, development should recognise the changing [and at times harmful effects of the] environment, and deliver increased resilience to the known effects of climate change and cumulative effects of environmental degradation.\n",
      "This includes, but is not limited to, resource scarcity; increased rainfall; higher temperatures; and air quality that falls below EU targets.\n",
      "The policy directly relates to the wider local Resilience agenda, and while other policies in this Sustainability and Climate Change chapter address specific issues, (energy, flooding and drainage, biodiversity and air quality) SC1 guides the cross-cutting use of these policies, ensuring that benefits to one issue / area are not at the expense of others.\n",
      "The policy contributes significantly to Plan objectives, particularly in relation to good growth that delivers sustainable development without undue harm to the environment (objective 3), the creations of high quality places people value and feel safe in (objective 2), and harnessing the opportunities of development to improve existing issues (objective 1).   5.2 The changing climate presents challenges worldwide; however it is important that communities respond and adapt to these challenges at the local level.\n",
      "This will be achieved through applying the principles of sustainable development – or development that is less unsustainable.   5.3 Climate change is central to national and regional planning policy.\n",
      "The London Plan requires development to contribute to the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change and achievement of the Mayor of London’s carbon emissions target.\n",
      "In Newham, the highest standard of sustainable design will be required, in line with the London Plan.   5.4 Use of nationally recognised sustainable design and construction standards enables a transparent and robust approach to improving the sustainability of development; as such, minimum BREEAM scheme standards are set out for different scales of non-residential development.\n",
      "In addition, given London’s status as a water stress zone with the picture only likely to worsen as result of population growth and global warming, a specific water efficiency target is applied to non-residential development as well as that already expected of residential development.   5.5 Given the history of land use in Newham, including heavy industry and utilities infrastructure throughout much of the Borough, the situation today is that development must contribute to amelioration of previous environmental harm, not just the avoidance of further harm.\n",
      "Specific examples include the need to remediate gasholder sites (unusually prevalent in Newham) and the need to investigate (and where necessary remediate) ground contamination to avoid harm to groundwater sources.\n",
      "Water quality is specifically addressed by the Environment Agency’s Thames River Basin Management Plan, which transposes the principles of the EU Water Framework Directive to the local context and ensures consistency of response to water environment management across London and the UK.   5.6 Improving energy security through maximum use of locally-available energy sources plays in to the Council’s wider Resilience agenda, as does the prioritisation of local supply in other forms including food growing, labour, and other resources.\n",

      "This policy contributes to Resilience and “good growth” objectives by promoting energy efficiency (thereby reducing costly fuel use) and supporting local energy generation that is designed and managed according to local objectives including reliability, cost and minimising the harmful air quality and global warming impacts of certain energy generation technologies (objectives 1, 2 and 3).   5.19 Low Carbon development is central to national and regional planning policy; the strategic principles, spatial strategy, and design and technical criteria set out in the Policy transfer drivers to the local context.\n",
      "Efficient, affordable, reliable and environmentally-beneficial energy solutions should be seen as central and advantageous to development as opposed to additional burdens upon developers; indeed viability testing has shown that costs are readily absorbable when factored in at design stage, which given the Pan-London approach, is increasingly typical.   5.20 In order to deliver the Zero Carbon targets of the London Plan, all development, including that which modifies existing buildings rather than being new-build, must play its part, and ensure that the performance is sustained.\n",
      "To this end, expectations around monitoring and the demonstration of compliance are set out for Major development schemes.   5.21 Localised energy solutions will contribute to the overall resilience of Newham, bearing in mind the requirements of policy INF4 in relation to infrastructure sufficiency.\n",
      "Given the substantial natural or waste resources presented by water source heat, sunlight/daylight, and ground and air heat, and the potential for heat network development in growth areas across the Arc of Opportunity, the spatial strategy identifies locally available energy sources, seeking to ensure developers exploit these resources / opportunities rather than ignore them in favour of easier, cheaper, and more traditional modes.\n",

      "That proportion rises to over 50% in Newham where the rivers Thames, Roding, and Lea comprise the southern, western, and eastern boundaries of the Borough.\n",
      "The history of development in East London also means that most growth areas within the Borough fall within those higher risk zones (i.e. the Arc of Opportunity, largely previously industrial land).\n",
      "Given the myriad benefits of growth and development, the need to meet national and regional growth targets, confirmation in national and regional policy that Local Planning Authorities must respond to the risks of flooding (NPPF 102-104 and London Plan 5.12-  5.13) and local residents’ concern around the frequency and severity of street flooding, this policy seeks to ensure that development of all scales and in all locations is contributing to an overall reduction in flood risk.\n",
      "As such, this policy contributes to most plan objectives as reducing flood risk through new development benefits the wider area (objective 1); the avoidance and minimisation of flooding is a key facet of high quality places in which people feel safe and secure (objective 2); and requirements ensure run-off is not harmful to / at the expense of the environment (objective 3).     5.29 As ‘flood risk’ means not only the likelihood of flooding but the severity of its impacts, and as flooding can arise from a wide range of sources, (tidal, fluvial, pluvial, groundwater, sewer overflow and reservoir failure) all development can contribute to reducing flood risk even where that need may not be immediately apparent.\n",
      "Climate change science means we know that rainfall and the likelihood of extreme weather events will increase, and cumulative impact thinking demands that all scales of development contribute to improved resilience.\n",
      "The need to improve surface water drainage and become more resilient to flood damage ties into the wider Resilience agenda and is acutely important in an area with above-average levels of deprivation and rented accommodation (i.e. where individual and community-wide economic resilience to withstand and recover from flood damage will be lacking). \n",

Developers should note that as the policy requires no worsening of flood risk to any location, off-site impacts will be considered as part of the application process and should be addressed by FRAs.  5.31 In addition to the national guidance referenced within the policy, the SFRA will be useful in informing implementation of the spatial strategy, which applies the sequential approach both across the borough and within individual sites (2a).\n",
      "The sequential approach means development should be directed towards the areas of lowest risk, and land prioritised according to vulnerability.\n",
      "The SFRA begins to demonstrate how this is done for large scale sites, while site-specific FRAs (where required) will inform the approach that should be taken with smaller sites.  5.32 Design and construction choices should aim to reduce the exposure of all new development to flooding and improve its resilience, thereby reducing reliance solely on the long-term maintenance of formal flood defences.\n",

      "It is additionally clarified by the Environment Agency that under-croft parking is not accepted as a form of flood water storage.  5.33 Development in the vicinity of rivers should note that flood defence structures often include underground elements such as anchors and tie rods; the ‘TE2100 Flood Defence Buffering’ line is indicative only and developers are responsible for investigating the status and nature of flood defences in consultation with the Environment Agency.\n",
      "The TE2100 Plan7 sets out the Environment Agency’s recommendations for managing tidal flood risk in the Thames Estuary up to the year 2100; while it makes recommendations about flood defence upgrades, riparian owners are primarily responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of defences.\n",
      "The purpose of riverside setbacks is not only to make ‘space for water’ (though the SFRA recommends it) nor an indication of planned and funded upgrade works, rather it is future-proofing to ensure the Borough can continue to be protected from an increased risk of fluvial flooding.\n",
      "The setback can additionally contribute to character and amenity objectives around keeping rivers and riverbanks accessible (SP1, INF6, and INF7).\n",

      "Newham, despite its urban structure and proximity to central London, supports a diverse array of wildlife, including species that have adapted their behaviours to urban environments.\n",
      "Development brings opportunities to enhance biodiversity and address past degradation, including that resulting from previous contaminative uses, dated methods of flood risk management, and a tendency to pave over garden space.\n",
      "The policy contributes to “good growth” (objective 3) and the creation of high quality places (objective 2).   5.42 The degradation and destruction of wildlife habitat is a major factor leading to the decline of biodiversity.\n",
      "To effectively tackle biodiversity loss, existing habitats must be safeguarded, (through protection and enhancement) and the overall extent of habitats must be increased (through the creation of new areas and their ongoing management).\n",
      "To this end, the potential for both direct and indirect (i.e. off-site) cumulative and in-combination impacts of a development on biodiversity will need to be assessed.\n",
      "Off-site impacts can occur through ecological pathways such as disruption to habitat connectivity, or runoff that affects water quality, together with effects generated by movement patterns (including impacts on air quality or of increased recreational use).   5.43 While by no means the only indicator of biodiversity value, the Local Plan protects 575.96 hectares of green space (14.93% of the overall Borough); a subset of these spaces as well as the rivers and docks are also designated Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation   From the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, see Natural England & DEFRA, Biodiversity duty: public authority duty to have regard to conserving biodiversity   (SINCs) – amounting to 16.92% of the Borough area.\n",
      "Based on data collected and shared by Greenspace Information for Greater London (GiGL), details of Newham’s SINCs can be found in Appendix 3 attached to INF6.\n",

      "As such, the principle of ‘net gain’ (and standardised assessment of it) is introduced to ensure all opportunities for biodiversity conservation and enhancement are taken up.   5.45 The London Plan incorporates a principle of improving access to nature; as such, increasing public access to SINCs, the green grid, and Blue Ribbon Network is supported (see policies INF6 and INF7) where the avoidance of harm to biodiversity can be demonstrated. \n",

      "Concern over the issue has grown in recent years, as illustrated by regional research5, national consultation6, and engagement feedback from Newham residents.\n",
      "The fact that air quality is one of the few environmental issues people are moved to comment on is testament to its harmful health and amenity impacts and justifies a Local Plan response that seeks to ensure all development considers impacts to, and risks associated with, air quality.\n",
      "With air quality such an integral part of quality of place, this policy contributes to multiple plan objectives including the creation of healthy places people choose to live and work in (objective 2), “good growth” and the avoidance of environmental degradation (objective 3), and using the opportunities presented by new development to address existing issues to the benefit of all (objective 1).   5.53 Given the sensitivity of the Epping Forest SAC to air quality, it is considered that any development likely to give rise to significant traffic generation on the sections of the A12 and/or the A406 which fall within 200m of the SAC will be likely to require assessment pursuant to the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010.\n",
      "A development may give rise to such traffic generation alone or in-combination with other development.   5.54 At the regional level, the issue of air quality is central to the Mayor’s Environmental Strategy which sets out that Local Authorities should use the planning system to reduce pollution from new development, encourage shifts to Zero and Low Emission modes of transport, and promote the use of green infrastructure and vehicle restriction to mitigate impacts.\n",
      "The strategy confirms that there are serious air quality implications in the use of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plants / Biomass Boilers, and that as the traditional grid moves toward decarbonisation, the benefits of CHP may no longer outweigh the harm.\n",
      "This should complement the introduction of the Ultra-Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ) and the Toxicity Charge (T-Charge) to try and deliver air quality improvements7.   5.55 Climate change effects are such that as temperatures increase, air quality will worsen and the effects of poor air quality will increase.\n",

      "The potential impact of development on the Epping Forest SAC would be expected to be considered as part of the HRA process to accompany any planning application where required8.\n",
      "That HRA process should have regard to all relevant information available, including the output of any current investigation of in-combination and cumulative impacts on the Epping Forest SAC.   5.58 The principles of using the design of structures and road networks to improve dispersal rates are of particular importance to polluting uses (bus and taxi locations, some waste and industrial uses) and along the principal road network.\n",

      "text:   6.1 A key component of the Council’s overarching objectives is to connect people to opportunities arising from development, deliver “Good Growth” and support an overall shift to a more sustainable pattern of movement in Newham.\n",
      "Newham’s ongoing regeneration (including its convergence with neighbouring Borough’s and with London as a whole) and its attractiveness for inward economic investment, are dependent to a large degree upon excellent strategic accessibility, and the ongoing ability to safely and easily move goods and people around the Borough and beyond without delay.\n",
      "Substantial investment has already taken place in recent years, including Elizabeth Line access at five stations (due to open in 2020), improvements to the Borough’s Tube service (including night tube on the Jubilee Line), the introduction of Cycle Superhighways and creation of the Leaway, and substantial capacity enhancements, rolling stock renewal and extensions of the Docklands Light Railway.\n",
      "Significant investment is also underway in re-modelling the Stratford Gyratory, upgrading the Greenway, further Leaway connections, and to improve passenger handling capability at London City Airport.   6.2 This investment contributes to the wider objective of Convergence, allowing the Arc of Opportunity to become an attractive location for investment as one of the best-connected parts of Greater London.\n",
      "However, it is also the case that strategic transport investment is not without negative impacts, which can include noise and disturbance, deterioration of air quality, the creation of new barriers and land blight particularly during protracted safeguarding periods, opportunity costs (e.g. other potential land uses/forms of place-making) and increased journey times for some, affecting residents, businesses and wider regeneration and development potential.\n",
      "These need to be acknowledged, addressed as far as possible at the design stage, preferably designing them out or at least mitigating them, and where persisting after this, carefully assessed and weighed up in assessing the acceptability of a scheme.\n",
      "Equally however, as per ‘Agent of Change’ principles, the policy acknowledges that other new development may bring land use conflicts with existing transport infrastructure, and as such needs to be designed to ensure that these are adequately mitigated and do not impinge on the safe and viable operation of strategic transport links.   6.3 Therefore, subject to this approach, this policy supports ongoing, programmed and future investment in the strategic transport network to assist the Borough’s ongoing regeneration and to stimulate inward investment and to secure an overall high quality transport service for Newham’s residents and businesses, recognising, as per the Mayor’s Transport Strategy (2018) that a ‘do nothing’ approach is inappropriate in light of significant growth, and already significant air quality and congestion impacts, with the particular need to achieve modal shift.\n",
      "Support will also be given to other, currently unfunded, strategic transport proposals that will contribute towards Newham’s regeneration and economic and physical development.\n",
      "The IDP, spatial policies and policies SP2, INF2, J1, J2 and J3 set out further detail on the need, progress and role of these different types of strategic transport interventions, which ultimately need to work together as part of a package by mode (this is particularly the case with road based river crossings) and overall to secure the best effects. \n",

      "It will be expected that this process and associated design and Environmental Statements should result in the clear articulation of the different environmental and spatial impacts of the proposals, (with particular reference to spatial policies S2-6 and thematic policies SC1-5, SP5, INF6&7 and INF2), and refinement of options and mitigation accordingly.\n",
      "Given that some strategic transport developments will result in changes in traffic distribution, where relevant, this should include screening of developments for in-combination SAC impacts as per the Local Plan HRA and HRA guidance.   6.5 The Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) identifies the types of infrastructure required to support the delivery of the plan.\n",
      "The IDP sets out the anticipated timing and phasing of the infrastructure provision, when development is likely to come forward and the availability of funding of development.   6.6 The Local Implementation Plan sets out a programme for funding and delivery of strategic and local transport schemes.\n",
      "The borough will be required to produce and update LIP3 documents which are expected in Spring 2019.   6.7 Development proposals that may impact either the operation and/or safety of London City Airport (LCY), navigable waterways and safeguarded wharves and public transport infrastructure, together with safeguarded new transport infrastructure alignments/corridors (river crossings) or utilities infrastructure (notably Beckton Sewage Treatment Works) should be discussed with the relevant consultees (including, TfL1, PLA2, Civil Aviation Authority3 (CAA), London City Airport4 and Thames Water) at the earliest possible stage to ensure the relevant safeguarding measures are implemented.\n",
      "Mapping available on the Council’s website5, and on the Policies Map (radar sightlines, mooring points and river access points) denotes relevant safeguarding/referral requirements but should not be the sole resource for understanding safeguarding requirements given the complex and technical nature of these matters.\n",
      "In addition, all noise-sensitive developments within designated Full Use London City Airport Noise Contours should comply with recommended internal noise levels and ventilation standards, and in the case of Major Applications also summer overheating prevention standards, as specified in the most up to date Building Regulations6.   6.8 Whilst proposals to encourage use of the Borough’s navigable waterways for various forms of transport are supported, the context for the development of new water transport facilities will be taken into account when determining the appropriateness of new water transport uses.\n",
      "For example, in areas with a context of employment uses, viable waterborne freight uses may be given preferential support over proposals to provide moorings for leisure craft.\n",

      "As part of healthy neighbourhoods, environmental impacts arising from transport, such as air and noise pollution which have significant impacts on people’s health and overall quality of life, must be addressed, and opportunities maximised to promote Active Travel and reduce the dominance of private car ownership and usage, and to reduce the impact of other motorised modes.   6.13 The importance of a policy for sustainable local transport is underlined by the predicted growth in employment and residential development in the plan period in the Borough, particularly in the Arc of Opportunity, East Beckton and at some Strategic Sites within Urban Newham.\n",
      "TfL modelling1 indicates that development growth will result in very significant consequences in terms of increased traffic congestion, public transport crowding and poorer network resilience to an extent that will affect development viability, economic performance and quality of life unless sustainable transport policies are implemented to spread travel demand.   6.14 Consequently, the Council wishes to support through investment a balanced approach to transport which seeks during the plan period to create the conditions in which people will, as a lifestyle choice, actively choose and indeed aspire to travel on foot, cycle and public transport in preference to travelling by car, supported by the proximity of a Metropolitan Centre at Stratford and new employment development.\n",
      "This is a ambitious, but considered necessary given the projected rise in the number of homes, jobs and other land uses which generate travel demand from a growing population, and certainly reflects latent potential in terms for instance of flat topography, attractive for cycling and the rivers for increasing passenger transport options and alleviating pressures on other modes.\n",

      "text:   6.45 Utilities infrastructure in London is already stretched; the levels of growth expected in Newham, and specifically in the Arc of Opportunity, means capacity of multiple kinds must be increased to facilitate the creation of new neighbourhoods (such as Beckton Riverside) and take up of economic opportunities (for example in the Royal Docks Enterprise Zone) that have a significant local and regional role.\n",
      "Known issues include water supply and sewage handling in the Thames Water area generally, energy supply/transmission infrastructure in the Royal Docks and the need to extend super-fast broadband, as per the IDP.\n",
      "If growth expectations are to be met, utilities enhancements must also work in tandem with new development in an already heavily-urbanised area and minimise land take as well as other spatial and environmental impacts (including noise, smell, and visual intrusion).\n",
      "Such pressure also extends to the increasing need to decommission and remediate the now unnecessary multiple gas holders in the area, which consume considerable areas of land, with legacy gas pressure (etc.) infrastructure being far more modest.   6.46 This policy contributes to all plan objectives, seeking to enable economic growth (objective 1), create high quality places that do not suffer the effects of utilities shortfall (objective 2), deliver “good growth” by embedding utilities needs and future-proofing to avoid further works and improve construction efficiency (objective 3), and balance local and strategic needs, for example in recognising that whilst facilities like Beckton Sewage Treatment Works may need to expand to meet [local and] strategic needs, that this should be counterbalanced by the minimisation of local impacts (Objective 4).   6.47 District heat networks are supported by national2 and London Plan planning policy as a means of meeting the requirements of the Climate Change Act to reduce UK CO2 emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.\n",
      "Networks can be implemented at the scheme/site level as well as neighbourhood-wide, taking strain off the traditional grid and encouraging use of more sustainable forms of energy generation.\n",
      "Growth expectations in the Arc of Opportunity not only provide the need for expansion but the opportunity; the development of energy and heat networks should be embedded in the earliest stages of planning and masterplanning new development.\n",
      "Part of facilitating heat network expansion is an accurate picture of potential and demand, as such all energy generating sources over a certain threshold should be included on the London Heat Map.   6.48 This policy helps make best use of locally available energy sources, supporting the implementation of policies SC1 and SC2 by (amongst other things) identifying relevant standards for heat network and heat pump installations (3d/e), and requiring their spatial impacts to be minimised as far possible (1b).\n",
      "Government research3 has shown the huge potential of Water Source Heat Pumps in the UK and London; as such, Newham’s Royal Docks asset and position alongside the Thames should be investigated for the potential benefits of a sustainable, renewable, and ‘free’ source of heat, helping to improve local energy resilience.\n",
      "Similarly heat pumps can be used to exploit ground, air, and waste heat (i.e. from transport of industrial processes); provided the environmental impacts of such installations are acceptable (including no worsening of air quality), their take-up is encouraged.\n",
      "These renewable technologies complement more widely understood options such as solar (PV), options for which should also be explored as an example of locally available / renewable energy (the Council notes that there is not considered to be significant potential for wind energy within the Borough).   6.49 Utilities needs are evolving, which makes definitive planning for them difficult at the point of design and construction.\n",
      "It is therefore logical to take an enabling approach: designing and building in additional capacity in terms of utility connection ducts, and providing for future connection to heat networks where present connection is not possible.\n",
      "Experience in the Olympic Park area for example, has shown that ‘passive ducting’ (beyond what was needed at the point of development completion) through development platforms has been taken up within a few years, achieving considerable cost savings on, for example, subsequent lighting and CCTV schemes. \n",

      "To ensure longevity and efficiency (including the avoidance of heat loss), heat network apparatus should be designed and constructed in line with the GLA’s Heat Network Manual or subsequent updates.   6.51 As per the minimising spatial impacts point, opportunities for retrospectively reducing the impacts of utilities infrastructure should be sought in addition to the expectation applying to new and expanded facilities.\n",
      "This might apply to the undergrounding of pylons, the siting, scale, and design of sub-stations, or the reconfiguration of existing sites such as Beckton Sewage Treatment Works.\n",
      "While expansion of capacity is supported, and will likely mean some expansion of operational land-take, solutions should be as space efficient as possible and mitigate impacts appropriately.\n",
      "However, this must necessarily work in conjunction with the ‘agent of change’ approach set out in policies SP8, J1 and J2 in relation to new development in the vicinity of such infrastructure, including ensuring that statutory [utilities] undertaker duties and safety requirements are met.   6.52 To confirm that sufficient capacity exists, applicants should liaise with utilities providers as early as possible to determine if an assessment needs to be undertaken.\n",
      "In the case of water and waste water it is expected that the impact of development both on and off-site is considered.\n",
      "In some instances it may be necessary to undertake appraisals to determine if a proposal will lead to overloading of existing water or waste water infrastructure.\n",
      "In the absence of detailed design and phasing, planning permission for developments which result in the need for off-site water/wastewater infrastructure upgrades may be subject to conditions to ensure the occupation is aligned with the delivery of necessary infrastructure upgrades.   6.53 Examples of relevant guidance for heat pump installations include the Environment Agency’s   Good Practice for Ground Source Heating4 or the (now abolished) Department for Energy and Climate Change’s Water Source Heat Pump research5.\n",
      "For any apparatus to be installed in waterways, developers should seek the advice of the Port of London Authority, Environment Agency, and Marine Management Organisation where relevant, and ensure all necessary licences can be achieved.   6.54 The London Heat Map6 shows existing and proposed heat networks in Stratford and the Royal Docks, including details of energy sources.\n",
      "Developers are encouraged to engage with the heat map to determine the opportunities associated with sites.   6.55 It is acknowledged that gasholder decommissioning and remediation is costly, though standard viability methodologies assume this is factored into viability calculations initially through land value and the concept of the ‘reasonable premium’ and then if necessary, via cross-subsidy from enabling development, if otherwise acceptable.   6.56 As per the IDP, the GLA are working with electricity infrastructure providers to resolve the pressing need for capacity upgrades to meet growing demand in the Royal Docks and Beckton.\n",

Today’s fragmented residential development will become consolidated into distinct but interconnected neighbourhoods, and benefiting from a network of new and enhanced green and open spaces and continuous waterfront access, and good access to stations, buses (including riverbuses), and an enhanced walking and cycling network.\n",
      "New neighbourhoods, at West Silvertown, Silvertown, North Woolwich, Royal Victoria Dock and Albert Basin, will each offer a range of quality community and social infrastructure including new schools, health care facilities, community meeting places and local retail and services, with further connections to facilities on the ExCeL estate and at Custom House/Freemasons local centre, and Canning Town, East Beckton, Beckton Riverside and Woolwich town centre;   b. New street-based local centres will be developed at Thames Wharf and West Silvertown focused around North Woolwich Road and the DLR stations, and North Woolwich Local Centre will be enhanced in terms of the quality and diversity of offer (including public realm) and nearby well connected complementary uses, with all centres benefiting from pedestrian and cycle links to neighbouring residential areas;   c. The sections of North Woolwich Road between Tidal Basin roundabout and North Woolwich Roundabout, and longer term, Albert Road between North Woolwich and Albert Island, will be reconfigured to provide high quality, active pedestrian environments at a human scale, and increased cycle and public transport network accessibility, in line with Policies SP7, INF2 and having regard to Policies INF6 and   d. Industrial areas will re-vitalise in consolidated form at Thameside East and West, in the Albert Island (benefiting from Enterprise Zone status) and St Marks LILs, anchored by successful businesses committed to the area, and new wharf and boatyard facilities, and buffered by modern industrial, flexible business and warehouse buildings that are configured to provide the necessary transition to neighbouring residential environments, achieving waterside access, separation of industrial and residential traffic and making use of river based transport, where possible, and market sensitive diversification of the accommodation offer, which will be further complemented by mixed use cultural and creative hubs around North Woolwich Station and in the Silvertown Arches LMUA;   e. Consolidation of four safeguarded wharves in the Royal Docks (Thames, Peruvian, Manhattan, and Sunshine) at Central Thameside West on Peruvian and Royal Primrose Wharves will achieve no net loss of functionality or wharf capacity with additional development conforming with the associated SIL designation and complementing the wharves, including through maintaining access to them;   f. A package of river crossings, accessible bridges over the docks to the ExCel Centre and over the rail corridor between London City airport and Connaught Riverside, new riverboat services, improvements to the DLR and bus services (which will have evolved to address [new] desired patterns of movement) and access to Crossrail services will provide strategic and local access for residents and visitors;   g.

The area’s key character assets, namely the open water and remaining historic buildings and structures of the docks, river/dockside views and access, and Victorian heritage of North Woolwich around the station, Woolwich Manor Way Area of Townscape Value, Lyle Park and Royal Victoria Gardens, will be re-valued and enhanced, whilst achieving appropriate mitigation of flood risk, ensuring that they form an integral part of the area’s future, with building heights decreasing with distance from Canning Town towards the east;   i. Local energy generation and district heating will be typical throughout the area with major developments being required to link and/or add to existing networks in addition to the provision of significant new energy transmission and ICT infrastructure to meet business, residential and transport needs; and   j.

      "Almost half of the area is water.\n",
      "Much of the area is industrial, particularly south of the docks, with important economic drivers in these areas and around including the ExCeL conference centre, Tate and Lyle, University of East London and London City Airport.\n",
      "The Docks have benefited from hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in recent years and the pace of change is becoming rapid, with new neighbourhoods emerging at Royal [Minoco] Wharf and an increase in planning applications coming forward on smaller sites, as well as infrastructure and social and economic regeneration projects underway partly under the auspices of the only Enterprise Zone in London.\n",
      "The Local Plan therefore needs to bring these opportunities together in a managed and coordinated way to maximise the long term benefits, acknowledging the opportunities for transformational regeneration, with potential to make a significant contribution to the borough’s objectives for providing new homes, jobs and services complementing and, where relevant, spatially referencing the ongoing joint-working between the GLA and the Council on the Enterprise Zone’s Detailed Delivery Plan and its financing, which will be further recognised in the evolving IDP.   1.21 In terms of design, some earlier development schemes were poorly integrated with each other and existing neighbourhoods, and the communities/neighbourhoods to the south of the Docks have lacked local facilities and defined Local Centres, as well as connections to nearby alternatives.\n",
      "The general quality of the urban environment continues to be a challenge with high levels of traffic, aircraft noise and heavy industrial activity, together with a lack of investment and legacy of poor post-war design in some areas, and some parts are isolated from the rest of Newham.\n",
      "The area’s relatively dispersed historic assets, including the Millennium Mills and Silo D, Former St Mark’s Church (Brick Lane Music Hall), and Victorian heritage of North Woolwich around the station and Woolwich Manor Way Area of Townscape Value, could also be better integrated and activated, and many form part of strategic allocations in the area that should help achieve this.\n",
      "Other important character assets include structures of the docks, river/dockside views and access, Lyle Park and Royal Victoria Gardens, as well as the more recent Thames Barrier Park.   1.22 With a Crossrail station opening at Custom House by 2018, reconfigured bus routes, enhanced DLR services, reactivating wharf operations and in the longer term, public transport links to the east and further river crossings, wharf consolidation and riverbus services, the strategic transport connections are improving.\n",
      "However, at a local level, finer grain connections for walking and cycling are still poor for local residents both within the Docks and from the surrounding area, and need to be improved, addressing key dock and rail corridor barriers, as well as the quality and comfort of the pedestrian and cycling experience, riverside and dockside access.\n",
      "Achieving the transformation of North Woolwich Road and Albert Road to pedestrian and cycle friendly activity streets, including through the activation of Silvertown Arches LMUA as a cultural hub, will be key to improving the connectivity and quality of the local environment.   1.23 London City Airport is a major employer and a catalyst for investment within the area, supporting London’s international role.\n",
      "Its presence is being consolidated by the City Airport Development Plan (CADP) to help optimise its capacity, further mitigate impacts and improve public transport access.\n",

      "However, the wharves are spaced out across the river frontage and the land is in many cases underused, as such it makes sense to consolidate, reactivate and relocate wharf facilities at Central Thameside West (see Figure 2.3b above), subject to no loss of functionality or wharf capacity, which would free up part of the river frontage for, and further enable, mixed use development at Lyle Park West and Thames Wharf.\n",
      "This will need careful phasing, management and design on the part of these Strategic Site developments to ensure neighbourliness and transition between uses, ensuring the remaining SIL remains functional and, reflecting its regional economic role.\n",

      "A London-wide review of safeguarded wharves has been commissioned, and the report will be published as part of the New London Plan in 2018.   1.25 Given the importance of the Royal Docks to the regeneration of Newham and development of London, and investment in strategic infrastructure capacity it is proposed to release a further part of Thameside West from its designation of Strategic Industrial Location at Lyle Park West and the western side of Silvertown Landing, adding to release already in train at Minoco Wharf.\n",
      "Similarly, partial managed release of SIL from Thameside East at the western side will allow for the delivery of a new riverside neighbourhood at Connaught Riverside, whilst sustaining the regional economic role of Thameside East, anchored by the Tate and Lyle sugar refinery.\n",

      "Whilst an approximate housing delivery has been calculated in accordance with methods described in the accompanying text of policy H1, it is acknowledged that evolving development opportunities mean that delivery may well far exceed the current estimates, in which case infrastructure requirements will need to be re-visited in discussion with the Council.   1.29 The Council will work with its partners including the PLA and GLA, to secure the release of the currently safeguarded Sunshine and Manhattan Wharves in the Royal Docks, and Thames Wharf in adjacent Canning Town and Custom House, upon their consolidation/ relocation within Central Thameside West; PLA are a consultee for any proposal affecting these wharves.\n",

      "Their management as a component of social infrastructure provision (meeting various needs, including access to shops, other services and community facilities) as well as part of economic growth (see Policy J1) is facilitated by recognition of this interdependency and clarity as to their differential roles and functions and the degree of change that can be accommodated without unintended negative impacts.\n",
      "This requires assessment of spatial, qualitative and quantitative patterns of use and future capacity for growth and change, and a borough-wide strategy that reflects them, alongside more qualitative change provided for as part of Policy SP6 and spatial policies and jobs polices that reflect the borough-wide economic development strategy.   6.60 In line with national and regional policy, a key component of this policy is that town centre related investment should be focused into centres, where that focus means it can have maximum effect on vitality and viability in terms of spend (e.g. through linked trips promoted) and qualitative impact (e.g. on the accessibility of the environment), not least due to the accessibility and footfall already denoted by these locations.\n",
      "A clear corollary to this is that existing out of centre development should be encouraged to either fall away, or re-locate into centres.   6.61 The remainder of the strategy set out in this policy reflects the fact that firstly, Newham’s main shopping/Town Centres currently account for only 57.3% of the Borough’s convenience and 62.3% of the Borough’s comparison expenditure, with leakage to centres outside the Borough accounting for much of the balance.\n",
      "Secondly, within the Borough, the southeast and north west dominate in terms of market share, with Canning Town and Forest Gate operating particularly marginally, and Gallions Reach and other out of centre retail parks considerably boosting the expenditure secured by the Town Centres (Green Street, East Beckton and East Ham) in the south-west.\n",
      "This is the justification for proposed transformational change affecting the hierarchy at Canning Town (see Strategic Site and S14) - to secure a major shift in expenditure patterns to the Borough’s economic, social and environmental benefit.\n",
      "Such growth and change should draw out of centre spending back into town centres, notably in the south-west, and out-of-Borough spending back within the area, particularly to Stratford.\n",
      "This builds on the opportunities presented by major investment already in train in these areas by Westfield at Stratford City, and by various regeneration partners at Canning Town, recognising the positive impacts these have on capacity through the added draw and consumer base they will create/have created.   6.62 East Ham, as Stratford’s nearest competitor, will also need to accommodate growth and change to retain its Major Centre status, building on its current strengths including a growing convenience role, good public transport connections as well as local walkability, and distinctive civic functions, and the availability of significant development sites (see Policy S6).\n",
      "This is also the case for the Borough’s other Town Centres, all of which need to at least renew their offer over the plan period to keep up with changing consumer trends and thereby continue to meet, or better meet, local (and wider) needs within a reasonable distance, and thereby contribute to a reduction in trade leakage.\n",
      "Although each town centre has seen some development, all have the capacity and strategic need for more, through strategic development sites, renewal of existing stock and the potential to increase densities.\n",
      "Green Street, and to some extent Forest Gate, together have the most capacity for growth and diversification, compared to East Beckton which is in an area already well populated by comparison provision and other food stores.\n",
      "East Ham and Green Street have a particular need to increase the range of unit sizes available to ensure that they offer some new larger units to attract mainstream retailers with ranges suitable to the centre’s role in the hierarchy, while also providing for smaller independents.\n",
      "Green Street however, also needs to accommodate the particular demand generated by its wider specialist destination status, whilst ensuring this occurs in such a way that the positive aspects of its character are enhanced.   6.64 Gallions Reach has always been regarded as an out-of-centre location in policy terms.   6.67 Below this, in the more remote parts of the Borough, where retail units are less commonly part of the urban fabric and there is insufficient scope for expansion, there are places where isolated shops should also be protected, and exceptionally created, where there are no proximate strategic sites with scope to create more rounded provision, subject to appropriate capacity and impact testing. \n",

      "text:   6.63 There are accessibility issues in a number of Town Centres; Stratford, East Ham, Green Street and Canning Town.\n",
      "In Stratford, improving the capacity of the station will be of critical importance as the population grows and infrastructure comes under greater pressure.\n",
      "In Canning Town, it will be necessary for new development sites to include good access to the town centre across major barriers.\n",
      "There is a need for step-free station access to be provided in Green Street, as well as taking action to improve congestion in the town centre.\n",
      "In East Ham town centre, congestion issues and strategic transport needs need to be addressed in future development.\n",
      "Integration is another common theme, ensuring that centres operate as a cohesive whole –that is, so that the whole of a centre’s offer which gives rise to its position in the hierarchy and social infrastructure function is recognised and used.   6.64 Gallions Reach has always been regarded as an out-of-centre location in policy terms.   However, the reality is that it accounts for a significant amount of spend and hence employment in the Borough, is on the edge of an area of sub-regional population growth, and offers a qualitatively different offer to other nearby centres (Barking, East Ham and East Beckton).\n",
      "It is therefore proposed that it changes to become a Major town centre as part of the development of the Beckton Riverside site which will increase its local trading potential, recognising its current deficiencies in terms of its limited range and offer, the dominance of access by car despite some improvements to bus usage, and a layout and design that cuts it off from nearby residential areas.\n",
      "Allocation of Gallions Reach as part of the wider site allocation for a significant new piece of urban development would allow for the various constraints that impact on the site to be managed to best effect and for the retail provision to be better integrated into the town centre network.\n",
      "Importantly, the immediate focus therefore, should be on qualitative change and re-configuration rather than a net increase in floorspace, which should be closely linked to an increase in residents in the immediate Beckton Riverside area.\n",
      "Moreover, any changes in floorspace should be comprehensively masterplanned as part of wider changes to retail, residential and other employment, transport and utilities development in the area.   6.65 Analysis of the spatial distribution and accessibility of Local Centres from neighbourhoods across the borough, together with consumer survey data, reveals certain gaps in the network.\n",
      "In response to these gaps, development sites in accessible locations that should enable the establishment of new viable Local Centres serving new and existing communities have been identified.\n",
      "Elsewhere a benchmark of 400-800m (depending on the quality of the route) is used to denote accessibility within an easy 5-10 minute walk, in line with other policies promoting active travel, together with public transport access and consideration of the nearest alternatives.\n",
      "This benchmark and high footfall is deemed an appropriate locational criteria upon which to plan the establishment of other new local shopping, and other commercial- and community-service provision, rather than allowing it to come forward in an ad hoc dispersed manner which does not optimise viability.   6.66 Conversely, some groups of shops are found to be very limited in their offer and locational potential and hence scope for growth to include other community uses, but from a food access perspective, together with other clusters, they fill an important local role, where larger defined Local or Town Centres are further away.\n",
      "This is the justification for the lower-level designation of Local Shopping Parade (LSP), with concern to protect retail rather than allow deterioration to a collection of hot food takeaways, as risks happening in some.\n",
      "The evidence base detailed in the 2014 paper Evidence Base - Local Shopping Parades, and the Options Appraisal (2015) sets out the justification for the designations and an analysis of the form and function of the parades.   6.67 Below this, in the more remote parts of the Borough, where retail units are less commonly part of the urban fabric and there is insufficient scope for expansion, there are places where isolated shops should also be protected, and exceptionally created, where there are no proximate strategic sites with scope to create more rounded provision, subject to appropriate capacity and impact testing.   6.68 A local threshold for impact assessment for out of centre proposals was recommended as per National Policy in the Newham Town Centre and Retail Study 2010 (updated in 2016).\n",
      "This is set low, reflecting in-centre development opportunities and Newham’s particular problems with small-scale out of centre retail developments, with aggregate impacts on the definition of the town and local centre network, vulnerable centres and ground floor activation (unlettable voids - see Policies SP3 and J1). \n",

      "text:   6.101 Community facilities are defined for the purposes of this policy as spaces for education (from pre-school to further and higher education) and training, healthcare, older people’s housing and specialist provision for other vulnerable people (falling into Use Class C2), social, leisure, children’s playspace, playing pitches and fields (including MUGAs) and associated facilities, places of worship, burial spaces, community spaces (including pubs in lawful D2, A4 and certain Sui Generis uses, public toilets), cultural and civic uses (including criminal justice and court facilities) and emergency services.   6.102 Achieving ‘good growth’, and an active and connected community supporting Resilience and Convergence objectives is about ensuring that residents and businesses have the local infrastructure and services they need and that give them choice about how they access services to maintain and improve quality of life.\n",
      "The Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) sets out the assessed need for increased capacity in relation to healthcare, education and childcare in the Borough.\n",
      "These are essential components of the community facility network and will be prioritised in order to ensure the needs of the Borough are met.\n",
      "These and other identified community facilities needs – for provision to expand, be newly provided, or in some cases be re-configured/oriented are reflected in Strategic and non-Strategic Site allocations where need in the plan period and scope (for development/ intensification etc.) is known.\n",
      "Key for the Borough are new education, healthcare and flexible community facilities, many of which provide an element of childcare.   6.103 To ensure that community facilities make the most effective use of land, a key component of the policy is to ensure that facilities meet local need.\n",
      "This is relevant to both the assessment of proposed new facilities on Strategic Sites and elsewhere, as well as the assessment of the appropriateness of loss of land/premises with lawful community facility use.\n",
      "In turn it is supported by careful location, design and management to ensure facilities will continue to meet [potentially changing] need over time, and preferably meet a range of needs at any one time, being inclusive, accessible, welcoming and flexible.   6.104 Co-location of facilities and services alongside other policy compliant uses, notably housing, can also achieve land us efficiency and be beneficial for the viability of a facility, given residential land values.\n",
      "It could also be deployed to help address recruitment difficulties for key workers as well as enhancing overall security.\n",
      "Given evermore constrained sites, the policy also promotes the use of innovative solutions including meanwhile provision on Strategic Sites to enable redevelopment of an existing site.\n",
      "Other innovative solutions could include the use of shared facilities or multi-storey provision (such as roof top playgrounds), or in some cases off-site shared provision of playing pitches and other facilities.   6.105 There are also moves towards commissioning and personal models of service provision, customer access strategies, shared services and greater collaboration, both within the public and local community sector.\n",
      "The Council and other commissioners/providers will therefore need to carefully consider the use of its existing assets and work together with partners, including the private and voluntary sector, to deliver quality services with effective use of land and buildings.\n",
      "This is particularly relevant when considering asset disposal, given that what might be surplus to one provider could be used by another, as well as new facility provision, where opportunities for co-location may be evident.   6.106 Town and Local Centres, within accessible areas, are prioritised for the location of community facilities, helping to promote access to services across the Borough in accordance with the wider vision and spatial strategy.\n",
      "That said, policy criteria recognise particular circumstances where there is the potential and logical justification in light of other policy objectives and recognised delivery realities for the location of community facilities elsewhere, subject to careful management of impacts via tight criteria. \n",

      "Other policies to which there is a logical link are highlighted, encouraging responses that deal with the issues in an integrated way.   6.108 The Council will use its land and buildings to provide community facilities in response to local needs, where appropriate in partnership with other public agencies, the private sector and the voluntary sector.\n",
      "In line with the corporate community cohesion and sustainable communities approach, the Council will continue to support the facilitation of inter-group working to make co-use and -development possible to meet local needs.   6.109 The policy seeks to ensure that applicants consider how best to maximise the effectiveness of community facilities not only through careful design and management, but also in the context of the broader spatial strategy which balances the need for community facilities with other demands on land.\n",
      "Early consideration of design, locational and needs based justifications will be explored through pre-application advice and design review.   6.110 Recognising the importance of publicly-accessible toilets for many members of the community, provision of these will be one way of demonstrating that a facility is welcoming, inclusive and open and available to all members of the local community.   6.111 The policy allows for the provision of community facilities under certain specific circumstances in out of centre locations where it meets a localised need.\n",
      "In relation to childcare provision the term ‘facility users’ refers to children and not parents.\n",
      "Applicants will be expected to demonstrate that the users of the facility will not exceed 15 people at any one time.\n",

      "The IDP will form an important part of demonstrating sufficiency of, or requirement for, community facilities across the Borough throughout the plan period due to the live nature of the document which will be updated annually to ensure it remains current.\n",
      "In relation to applications for the loss of community facility floorspace, peppercorn rents as a demonstration of market rent, are not acceptable.\n",
      "In the case of release of playing pitches or fields, as per the NPPF, part 3.e.i of this policy will be the required test; this should be applied in conjunction with policy INF6 which sets out a presumption of protection for all designated green space.   6.113 When proposing facilities within CFOA areas, applicants are expected to evidence a lack of suitable available and affordable sites within in-centre locations and be able to demonstrate a clear end user of the facilities.\n",
      "Proposals for speculative D1 development are not considered to be acceptable within Community Facilities Opportunity Areas.   6.114 In setting out a presumption in favour of health, education and childcare facilities on Strategic Sites, it is intended that community facilities floorspace in these areas be offered to relevant providers first.\n",
      "Where they do not require floorspace on the site, or where additional community facilities floorspace is proposed that would be surplus to their needs, provided that the applicant can adequately meet other policy criteria, including that which relates to demonstration of local need, the policy does not preclude floorspace coming forward for other community uses.\n",
      "There are a number of Strategic Sites which include specific requirements for the provision of community facilities within the sites to meet needs arising (from the site or the site and wider area) notably: Connaught Riverside – S23, Thames Wharf – S08, Coolfin North – S06, and Beckton Riverside – S01 (where education facilities are specified), and Queen’s Market – S27 (where healthcare is specified in the site allocation).\n",
      "It is expected that location, scale and format of the facilities within the site will be agreed in the course of masterplanning in consultation with commissioners/providers through the pre-application process.\n",
      "In turn it should be noted that further community facilities needs may be identified as part of the iterative process of capacity testing on these sites (as per INF9 and INF8:1a) which would be accounted for through their allocation for ‘mixed use’ overall. \n",

      "text:   6.120 Infrastructure sufficiency is defined as having enough infrastructure capacity in the right places at the right time to meet needs arising (existing and future needs) in ways that meet reasonable expectations.\n",
      "Such reasonable expectations relate to planning benchmarks and those achieved Pan-London and more locally, as well as those set out elsewhere in the Plan, (including accessibility benchmarks described in INF2 & INF5) the IDP and technical studies, and impact modelling on quality of life, business continuity, blight/ opportunity cost and the environment.\n",
      "Capacity may be new or existing, particularly through enhancements to existing, and assessments will need to be mindful of existing deficits, accessibility constraints (physical, financial, temporal, inclusivity) and the role of identified sites in addressing deficits in light of the overall scarcity of sites, particularly for open space and community facilities such as schools and healthcare.   6.121 Demonstrating infrastructure sufficiency will therefore include an assessment of [gross and net] infrastructure needs arising, and how these will be met on or off site, whether through physical (e.g. provision of floorspace, floorspace flexibility or access improvements) or financial contributions (e.g. Mayor of London and Newham CIL, S106) or other undertakings (e.g. relating to public access or user charges) necessary to make an application acceptable in planning terms.\n",
      "As part of this, particularly where the IDP indicates evolving plans, engagement will need to occur with key providers/undertakers/ commissioners, such as Thames Water, the Newham CCG and the Council.\n",
      "The Council offers a range of pre-application services in order to help applicants develop their proposal in accordance with planning policy.\n",
      "Early engagement with the Council, infrastructure providers and commissioners and other statutory consultees plays an important part in achieving successful planning outcomes, particularly for large scale and complex cases where infrastructure planning is likely to be an iterative process in tandem with capacity testing.   6.122 For small sites and windfall sites, infrastructure needs are likely to be less substantial and the infrastructure assessment should be proportionate to the scale of the development.\n",
      "However, cumulative impact may still be an issue and the availability of services and facilities in accessible locations will be particularly relevant to an application.\n",

      "However, this is not a responsibility that falls to the local authority in isolation.\n",
      "The development of infrastructure requires investment from a range of sources including healthcare providers, water and sewerage undertakers, national agencies, and developers.\n",
      "Where there is a substantial programme of development or regeneration, such as in Newham, there is a need for the investment strategies of the various agencies to be effectively coordinated through integrated infrastructure planning, and for growth (notably of housing, but also of employment space) to occur alongside the evolution of infrastructure.\n",
      "The ultimate objective is to ensure ‘good growth’ is achieved, maintaining and preferably enhancing quality of life, rather than resulting in unacceptable impacts and externalities.   6.117 It is important for the Council and other infrastructure providers to have a firm grasp of the infrastructure needs of the future, and how they relate to existing plans of service providers to improve service delivery.\n",
      "The planning process provides a forum within which to align providers’ plans with expected population and household growth because it is important to identify any remaining funding gaps for infrastructure provision after these plans have been assessed and because there needs to be a sound basis for the infrastructure specified in site allocations and for the collection of developer contributions.   6.118 The NPPF confirms that the Local Planning Authority should engage with authorities and providers to assess the quality and capacity of infrastructure for transport, water supply, wastewater and its treatment, energy (including heat), telecommunications, utilities, waste, health, social care, education, flood risk and coastal change management, and its ability to meet forecast demands.\n",
      "The outcome of such engagement, set out within Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) and reflected in the spatial and thematic policies demonstrates how the infrastructure needs arising from the strategy set out in the development plan will be met, including provision for managing ‘known unknowns’ which are the inevitable consequence of varying planning horizons and processes.\n",
      "As such the IDP has been embedded within policy to signpost to infrastructure providers, land owners and developers the full costs of delivering schemes in the Borough and the associated impact on demand/need for infrastructure and services.   6.119 Some [infrastructure] policy requirements are subject to viability, and the variety of cost demands on a development means it is helpful to specify which of these are most important in light of the overall vision and objectives of the Plan.\n",

      "This Act places a general duty on the council as a public body to pay due regard to advancing equality, fostering good relations and eliminating discrimination for people sharing certain protected characteristics.\n",
      "EqIA is therefore an essential tool for demonstrating the Council has complied with the law by shaping the way decisions are taken and thereby improving outcomes.\n",
      "It enables a good understanding of needs and differential impacts that Local Plan policies may have on different groups.   Family Housing: Houses or flats within Use Class C3 containing three or more bedrooms.\n",
      "This definition reflects the Council policy objective to retain a range of family sized accommodation, (including very large houses) and to prevent their subdivision into smaller units.   Good Growth: Growth (and development) that is socially, economically and environmentally sustainable, whereby growth:  • in housing numbers and population is balanced against that of the infrastructure and jobs needed to support it;  • is not at the expense of the environment / resources;  • does not result in compromises in quality; and  • is optimised in relation to strengths and opportunities, for the benefit of new and existing residents.\n",
      "Good Growth forms the overarching Objective 3 of this Plan, and is established in policy by S1:1c.     Green Corridors: This refers to relatively continuous areas of open space leading through the built environment, which may be linked and may not be publicly accessible.\n",
      "They may allow animals and plants to be found further into the built-up area than would otherwise be the case and provide an extension to the habitats of the sites they join.   Greenfield Run-off: The rate of run-off that would occur from the site in its undeveloped and undisturbed state.   Green Infrastructure (GI): Open environment within urban areas, the urban fringe and the countryside.\n",
      "It is a network of connected, high quality, multifunctional open spaces, corridors and the links in between that provide multiple benefits for people and wildlife.   Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA): A requirement of the European Directive 92/43/ EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora (the ‘Habitats Directive’), implemented in the UK through the provisions of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010.\n",

Health Impact Assessment (HIA): A systematic approach to predicting the magnitude and significance of the potential health and wellbeing impacts, both positive and negative, of new plans and projects.\n",
      "The approach ensures decision making at all levels considers the potential impacts of decisions on health and health inequalities.\n",
      "HIA is particularly concerned with the distribution of effects within a population, as different groups are likely to be affected in different ways, and therefore looks at how health and social inequalities might be reduced or widened by a proposed plan or project.   Heritage Asset: A building, monument, site, place, area or landscape positively identified as having a degree of significance as a component of the designated heritage assets (those buildings, monuments, structures, parks, etc. that are subject to national listing/scheduling, and those areas designated as Conservation Areas) and assets identified by the local planning authority during the process of decision-making or through the plan-making process (including local listing). \n",

      "It is applicable as much to proposals for ‘meanwhile’ uses, as more permanent ones, as such uses often prevail, and therefore have a significant impact in relation to the realisation of wider community visions.\n",

      "While there are many existing strengths, many of these components (or the relationship of development to them) are in need of improvement or adjustment according to local people and other stakeholders.   2.3 Within a sizeable borough such as Newham, it is reasonable to expect a number of places of a scale that people can easily relate to and interact with in their day-to-day lives, that should be integrated and connected in a manner which recognises that one place is unlikely to fulfil a person’s needs in their entirety, and that people expect to be able to move freely and easily within an extended area.\n",
      "This is a key issue in the borough due to physical barriers and poorly conceived urban structure and street networks, contributing to the creation of harsh ‘edges’ rather than smooth transitions between areas.   2.4 The distinctiveness of these places matters: positive distinctive identities are not only generally pleasing and conducive to creating a sense of somewhere people value and can feel they belong to, but also aid navigation across the wider area, and more fundamentally, boost economic competitiveness and robustness.\n",
      "It ensures places have a unique offer so that they draw on a particular segment of the market and locally-specific strengths and opportunities, whilst addressing locally-specific weaknesses and threats, creating a borough that is stronger as a whole.\n",
      "This is why clear visions for places based on an analysis of character are important, recognising the need to address their coherence with a view to reinforcing or creating positive identities – again a key issue in Newham.   2.5 This policy, therefore, directly relates back to the Vision (Policy S1) - that Newham should be covered by a more coherent and comprehensive range of readily identifiable, connected and integrated successful places. \n",

      "text:   2.11 Improving health and well-being is one of the main priorities identified in Newham, and national and London-wide planning policies, which recognise the relationship with socioeconomic and environmental factors.\n",
      "This policy therefore has an important role in achieving the Plan’s overarching objective of creating high quality places and delivery of resilience and convergence of outcomes.\n",
      "The health status of Newham’s residents is, in general, worse than the London average due to a higher mortality rate from circulatory diseases and diabetes, lower than London average life expectancy, poor cancer survival rates and high incidence of respiratory illnesses and mental health problems.\n",
      "Newham suffers from poor air quality and fails to meet national air quality standards, which impacts on human health particularly the old, the young and those with existing lung and heart conditions.\n",
      "Newham also has one of the highest rates of physically-inactive adults and one of the highest rates of obese children in London.\n",
      "Limiting long-term illnesses are also prominent within the population.\n",
      "There is an urgent need to improve people’s diets and physical activity rates, reduce stress levels, exposure to environmental pollutants and ensure that everyone can enjoy opportunities on offer, whatever their ability.   2.12 Planning by delivering growth and optimising development in accordance with the overarching objectives of the Plan can play a crucial role in addressing these issues, and Newham has a unique opportunity in terms of the development opportunities in the borough, enabling the principles of healthy neighbourhoods to be incorporated in new neighbourhoods from the start, clean-up of contaminated land and a shift to cleaner, greener industries and logistics, and getting more people into work, which have a crucial link to ill health.\n",
      "However, it will also be important to improve existing neighbourhoods, where much of the population will continue to live, as these are progressively re-shaped over time.   2.13 Across much of the borough the number of hot food takeaways and relatively poor availability of healthy food remains a cause of significant public concern, with key links made with child’s and adult health, as well as wider amenity issues.\n",
      "The cumulative impact map of the borough in respect of hot food takeaways shows extensive areas of saturation (see SP9 and associated evidence base).\n",
      "Planning has come forward as an important agent in tackling the number of hot food takeaways in Newham by controlling their spatial distribution so minimising their impact on public health particularly in relation to schoolchildren.\n",
      "Young people’s access to such food, and the dietary patterns with health consequences that are established at a young age are an acknowledged concern at national level.   2.14 The converse of this, more positive planning for local and inclusive accessibility to quality facilities and amenities, providing for physical activity, access to nature, healthy food, healthcare, not only increases the likelihood of people benefiting from such facilities with indirect and direct health consequences by reducing psychological barriers to access, but also increases the likelihood they will use them by fitness-contributing, and pollutionreducing active travel modes.\n",
      "It can also help address people’s work/life balance by reducing the time needed to access essential goods and services.   2.15 In the context of the need to increase employment in Newham, greener industries, and measures to address noise, air and odour pollution and other environmental impacts of economic development are particularly important.\n",
      "This is because the area has long been a favoured location for ‘dirty’ industries and utilities, due to originally being outside the City of London’s stricter jurisdictions.\n",
      "These continue to impact on the local environment and people’s health, both directly (contributing to environmental pollutants and stress) and indirectly (e.g. preventing people’s enjoyment of stress-alleviating open space).   2.16 This is also the case in respect of a legacy of relatively poor quality housing, or management or unmitigated local environments that have resulted in it becoming so, together with poor design or wider neighbourhoods.\n",
      "Housing quality is known to have direct and indirect effects on physical and mental health and well-being through impacts on temperature, exposure to mould and pollutants, security, ability to meet changing household needs, and the ability to provide stress alleviation (spaces of retreat and safety).\n",
      "Appropriate housing mix, including specialist housing, a range of sizes and tenures will also be important to address these contributors to health. \n",

      "text:   2.17 This policy is over-arching, drawing together the elements of healthy neighbourhoods promoted across the Plan, and the importance of taking a proactive and holistic approach to health impacts, seeking to maximise the impact of interventions of other partners where possible.\n",
      "As such, implementation is generally through the deployment of other policies signposted, notably SP9 for management of cumulative impacts, and SP8 for management of externalities.   2.18 Access to healthy food may be promoted through planning by protecting the viability, vitality and diversity of Town and Local Centres, isolated shops, or clusters of shops which fill in gaps between designated centres, ensuring most people are within a 5 minute walk of a shop in line with Policies SP6 and INF5.\n",
      "Allotments and community food growing projects on opportunity sites (sites awaiting development, and Strategic Sites) may also contribute to this agenda (see Policies INF7 and SC1 and the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP).\n",
      "These principles, and access to other community facilities (e.g. schools, health care, community meeting places, open space, playspace and parks) and employment defined as ideally within a 400-800m distance of people’s homes (a 5-10 minute walk) are also taken forward by INF8, INF7 and spatial and jobs policies which promote mixed use areas.   2.19 For this reason, the trade-offs between the provision of more centralised, economically efficient, modern and specialist facilities, and retention of local facilities, need to be carefully considered.\n",
      "Equally however, attention to the quality of walking and cycling links between housing and facilities is important, as distance is not the only factor in encouraging active travel.\n",
      "This includes providing for quieter routes that are less exposed to high traffic levels and hence air pollutants, though also trying to reduce polluting travel modes on all roads through encouraging sustainable freight and cleaner engine technologies, as per INF1,   2.20 Quality housing in health terms means minimising exposure to pollutants by adequate spacing from main roads and dual aspect ventilation; providing for good insulation to tackle warmth and damp issues; good space standards (internal and amenity) to reduce stress, with the particular implications this has for housing density; flexibility to respond to changes in household circumstances (children, ill health and disability) and climate change (appropriate temperature management and protection from extreme weather); and safe and secure design – also in the wider neighbourhood (as per SP3, H1, H4, H3, SC1).\n",
      "A certain proportion of specialist units to meet particular healthcare needs will also be important, with inclusion more generally promoted through an appropriate housing mix as per H3, H2, H4 & H1).   2.21 Beyond the home itself, in addition to those already discussed, health contributors will include better design of mixed use areas to minimise and mitigate externalities of economic activity including appropriate separation and buffering of uses, restrictions on further intensification of uses, and [retrospective] mitigation, with further detail set out in SP8, SP9, and SC policies.\n",
      "This will be particularly relevant in the consideration of any further airport expansion as per Policy INF1.\n",
      "The current Air Quality Action Plan and Public Safety/ Health and Safety Zones around the airport and hazardous installations should also be complied with or addressed as appropriate as per SP9 and SC5.   2.22 The process of Health Impact Assessment (HIA) can help to scope and address health impacts in a systematic way for larger developments.\n",
      "Developers will be expected to conduct an HIA for Major residential /mixed use proposals, or address its scope in their Design and Access Statements and Environmental Impact Assessments.   2.23 Health care and community partners and the Council will promote complementary lifestyle and business measures, to ensure people benefit as much as possible from changes to their environment.   2.24 Implementation of the Air Quality Action Plan by the Council and relevant partners, reviewing and updating it as necessary.   2.25 The Infrastructure Delivery Plan and ongoing needs assessments will ensure that health infrastructure needs are addressed through new and improved health infrastructure, as per INF8.   2.26 Further expert advice is available from health care partners (currently Newham CCG) and the Council’s Public Health Team as well as the guidance from the London Healthy Urban Development Unit (HUDU)1 and updates as appropriate.\n",

The expectation that all development realises a high quality of urban design in the new buildings and spaces created, helping to engender safe, sociable and inclusive mixed and balanced communities and places that people feel proud of;  b. The importance of contributing to the creation of, and continued support for, genuinely mixed use areas with an integrated range of high quality accommodation for living, community facilities and work places, ensuring easy and inclusive access to these and associated walking, cycling and public transport links;  c. The need to avoid problems related to ‘bad neighbour’ uses, (including hot food takeaways) vacant premises and inactive frontage, flood risk and cumulative impact;  d. The importance of minimising environmental impact, with sustainability features incorporated into buildings, spaces and neighbourhoods at an early stage of the design process in line with Policies SC1-5;  e. The importance of an analysis of local character and the specific attributes of the site, seeking to reinforce or create positive local distinctiveness, whilst securing integration and coherence with the local context including character assets in line with Policy SP5;  f. Respect for sensitivity to – and capacity for – innovation in different parts of the Borough, and the need for appropriate stakeholder and community engagement to help direct responsive design;  g. The desirability of making the public realm attractive as a social meeting place to be enjoyed by the whole community, and of creating a sense of safety and security and helping to prevent crime and anti social behaviour inside and outside buildings and in public spaces; and  h. The importance of providing legible, connected networks of streets, spaces and parks conducive to travel on foot or by bike.  2. Design and technical criteria  a.

      "This is one of the overarching objectives of the Local Plan, in addition to good design that supports the other objectives of optimising development and delivering growth.\n",
      "It is widely acknowledged that good design is the basis of successful regeneration initiatives.\n",
      "A robust, comprehensive and locally-specific design policy which applies to all scales and types of applications (including advertisements, telecoms and householders) is vital in this context given that despite support for good design at national, London-wide and local policy level, amongst some better and award-winning schemes in Newham, poorly conceived ones also continue to be put forward.\n",
      "Moreover, research1 shows that the cost of good design is minimal compared to the financial and other benefits that can be achieved through it.\n",
      "Importantly, good urban design comprises attention to a number of components: not just individual buildings, but also the spaces around them, the relationship with the surrounding area and connections between them, and the mix of uses provided for (which in turn impacts on those spaces).\n",
      "As such the policy emphasises that it is insufficient to address only certain aspects of design: it is expected that all aspects will be addressed, and carried through into credible plans for implementation and management.   2.29 Good design must encompass the balance and configuration of uses and connections in an area with implications for accessibility and travel time, road safety and efficiency, efficiency of land use and management of flood risk, flexibility over time, activation of spaces, safety and security, legibility, amenity and attractiveness.\n",
      "It is thus vital that design initiatives are considered on an area basis rather than a singular building or plot basis, in order that cumulative impact on these matters are properly considered, and that land uses are configured to best strategic effect.\n",
      "Failure to do so can erode legibility and is often unsuccessful, as reflected in the numerous poorly located and frequently vacant ground floor commercial premises in Newham, creating inactive frontage and hostile street level environments, and concern about congregations of unmitigated ‘bad neighbour’ uses, notably takeaways and bars (See SP9).\n",
      "Good design requires careful strategic planning in order to balance noise-sensitive uses and viable but noisy industry, and to address flood risk – so that responses (e.g. elevated ground floors) do not cause problems of their own (e.g. inactive frontage).\n",
      "Temporal considerations may also apply – ensuring that development plots or premises that are vacant awaiting construction or occupation are activated through ‘meanwhile’ uses that bridge the gap to longer-term visions.   2.30 However, also important is the range, quality, sustainability, accessibility and integration of design responses provided in an area, ensuring that there are choices available that reflect diverse and changing needs and aspirations, whilst avoiding social segregation, contributing to community inclusivity, mix and stability which are key Council priorities.\n",
      "Design quality considerations include the durability of materials and the appropriate scaling   CABE, ‘The Value of Good Design’; CABE, ‘The Cost of Bad Design’   and configuration of circulation and communal space; features relating to fitness for purpose including adequate living, storage and amenity space and privacy, the ability to alter and extend internal spaces, natural lighting and ventilation; and the extent to which buildings and spaces ‘delight’ - e.g.\n",

      "It should resolve rather than repeat past mistakes, whilst accentuating and integrating with the positive without simply replicating it.\n",
      "This process includes consideration of aspects of sensitivity which must be attended to (e.g. historic assets and their settings, whether the location is an important local meeting place) and capacity to absorb innovation.\n",
      "The latter is generally greater in the Arc of Opportunity on larger sites, but is also relevant in relation to under-performing assets.\n",
      "For larger sites and/or those that are more sensitive, a proportionate amount of community and stakeholder engagement should be undertaken, ensuring that the design responds to the needs and wishes of those who use or will use the environments created, and expert advice.\n",
      "It will also be important to establish design credibility by incorporating technical and financial details and provision for continuity of the project architect into the assessment remit given experience, particularly of third party implementation by ‘design and build’ firms, of value engineering and other imperatives which have diluted the design quality that has in part justified the scheme in the first place.   2.32 Spaces around buildings, including streets, parks, squares and so on are as important as buildings themselves in contributing to people’s experience of the built environment.\n",
      "Safety and security considerations are paramount for local people, and can deter people from using the public realm, public transport and particular buildings, as well as affecting how comfortable they feel in their own homes and places of work, and some groups are particularly affected (see IIA).\n",
      "In fact, most people have a low chance of being victims of crime but the numbers of people that are afraid or worried about something happening to them are relatively high.\n",
      "Increasingly, anti-terrorist measures2 and, in some places, and in relation to some uses (e.g. large leisure venues, stations) measures to manage large volumes of people (crowd safety) will be important.\n",
      "As well as activation, diversion/ dispersal, and surveillance provided by the arrangement of uses, provision of good lighting and sight-lines, a choice of routes in, out and across spaces, clear delineation of public and private space, and durability and maintenance are important.\n",

      "Elsewhere, in much of established Urban Newham, 5 storeys may be considered tall, though in most cases in the Arc of Opportunity 8-12 storeys would be the typical established height in newer development.\n",
      "To ensure the application of this policy to all tall building proposals in Newham, however, a tall building is considered to be six or more storeys and all proposals containing buildings of this height should be assessed against it.   2.39 There are many positive aspects to tall buildings which make them an attractive development from several perspectives.\n",
      "Tall buildings can help create and distinguish high quality placemaking which is one of the over-arching objectives of the Local Plan: they can be excellent works of architecture, and some of the best post-war examples are now statutorily listed.\n",
      "The introduction of a prominent visual feature into an existing townscape can change its character and appearance and present a better perceived ‘offer’ for the area to the rest of the borough and London.\n",
      "Tall buildings can thus be iconic buildings that define a strong sense of regeneration, economic vitality and status of place, creating new views and landmarks and helping to improve legibility by marking for instance, town centres and transport hubs.   2.40 Tall buildings also offer the opportunity to build to higher densities around public transport nodes/key routes and in town centres, helping to support their viability and vitality.\n",
      "They may accommodate significant numbers of new homes, and cross subsidise affordable housing, and employment-generating uses/community facilities in an intensely used and vibrant development that activates the surrounding area and makes new infrastructure viable.\n",
      "A tall building can offer flexibility between office, hotel and residential and other appropriate uses.\n",
      "They can also help secure the redevelopment of small sites with high land values, or sites which need to ‘give’ land to open space, view or route corridors or to buffer industrial uses, roads and rail infrastructure.\n",
      "This form of development therefore can help promote mixed use areas, mixed communities and aid growth, optimising development potential in light of local and strategic needs.   2.41 Conversely, a poorly designed tall building may create an isolated mono-community with little social interaction within the building and with the wider community in the area.\n",
      "The economics of building a taller building with its higher service charges may not necessarily optimise the housing opportunities available to residents in the borough.\n",
      "There may also be problems of ‘ownership’ and intensity of use of communal areas if not designed in such as way as to secure communal responsibility and ensure durability.   2.42 A principal failing with tall buildings can be a lack of understanding of the nature of the area around them, and failure to demonstrate neighbourliness (see SP8).\n",
      "Issues of local wind flow disruption, temperature reductions at pedestrian level around tall buildings, overshadowing and street pollution flushing effects will have implications for the amenity of those living or working in or around the buildings.\n",
      "Perhaps most importantly, a tall building if not in the right place and if not well designed including treatment of the surrounding public realm, will by virtue of its size and widespread visibility, seriously harm the qualities that people value about a place, disrupting rather than enhancing place character.   2.44 The design and management specifications for tall buildings are high, reflecting the particular effort needed to overcome the disadvantages of tall buildings and their potential negative impacts locally, to ensure their strengths are more prominent.\n",

      "In addition, mid-rise development has less impact on surrounding dwellings, less overshadowing, and offers more opportunities for social interaction.\n",
      "As such, it is worthwhile to consider alternative ways of providing high density development, given that 2 to 4 storey combinations of mews housing and flats and maisonettes can yield densities of up to 120 dwellings per hectare.\n",
      "This is particularly relevant in relation to the qualitative criteria specified, notably sustainable community objectives described in more detail in the Homes Section, where housing mix and choice (including a greater proportion of family housing), and overall high quality housing with appropriate amenity space, are prominent themes.\n",
      "This is significant because research has shown that tall buildings with high child densities, and for where social housing forms a significant proportion of units, are more intensively used, and hence unless very carefully designed and managed, potentially less successful.\n",
      "Another consideration is that service charges in tall buildings, when not capitalised, can reduce affordability, particularly for shared ownership units.\n",
      "The emphasis in the local plan on mid-rise development as the preferred form for tall buildings in the borough is based on these considerations, requiring specific demonstration of their added value.   2.44 The design and management specifications for tall buildings are high, reflecting the particular effort needed to overcome the disadvantages of tall buildings and their potential negative impacts locally, to ensure their strengths are more prominent.\n",

      "A similar approach is taken to the Strategic Sites in Urban Newham where there will be more limited opportunity for tall buildings given the more tightly woven, lower rise existing urban grain and heritage assets, which will need to be reflected in their scale.\n",
      "As in the Arc of Opportunity, Strategic Sites appropriate for tall buildings are allocated in Urban Newham with an indication of an acceptable height for each site.   2.52 This approach delivers a scale of individual sites and clusters of sites which allow for appropriate masterplanning and the specific siting and formation of tall buildings and/or other forms of higher density development to best effect.\n",
      "Ensuring that scale is appropriate as part of place-making means sensitivity to local and historic context and character as per Policies SP1, SP3, and SP5, but also the degree of public transport accessibility, place hierarchy (distinguishing between town and local centres and their hinterlands, and reflecting the town centre hierarchy set out in INF5), and enclosure and integration objectives for Key Corridors and linear gateways (see policy SP7).\n",
      "This also means ensuring that these clusters and locations remain distinct, rather than joined by long lines of tall buildings.\n",
      "In this regard, an emphasis on stepping down and transition in scale are important to establish satisfactory relations with surrounding development, and in some cases stepping back (above a certain height may help in more low rise areas/smaller sites) will also be important.   2.53 Elsewhere in the Borough outside the Strategic Sites there will be limited opportunities for the development of tall buildings.\n",
      "A minimum PTAL level 4 is expected at tall building developments outside the allocated Strategic Sites, and scope to create generous public realm.\n",
      "This again will usually imply location adjacent to key transport nodes, (bus stations, train and underground stations) and site size and location that affords significant public realm opportunities.\n",
      "Along key corridors (see Policy SP7) however, marginal increases in height (by 1 or 2 storeys) may nonetheless be acceptable to help improve enclosure and integration of existing buildings and public realm, with scope for possible mid-rise developments in town centres and adjacent key transport nodes.   2.54 Additional, more detailed work concerning location and formation within this spatial framework will be necessary to ensure such buildings contribute positively as envisaged.\n",

Alternative ways of providing high density development (including various height mixes) in this location and the specific added value that the tall building(s) bring to the scheme in comparison.  2.

      "The town centres are characterised by high PTAL ratings and ready availability of services making them appropriate locations for high density development.\n",
      "Tall buildings have the potential to deliver quality place-making with associated socio-economic benefits by providing buildings of high architectural quality as well as improvements to the public realm.\n",
      "The spatial benefits of guiding tall buildings to town centres include enhancement of the centre’s vitality and viability.\n",
      "Local centres in turn are also important locations within a neighbourhood which may justify a proportionate marker in height terms, cognisant of local character as per SP3 and the relevant spatial policy.  2.48 In line with this policy approach, Stratford Metropolitan and Canning Town Town Centre are therefore distinguished by their being the areas in the Borough where new tall buildings over 20 storeys should be focused, supported by additional tall buildings of lesser height.\n",
      "The particular formations of these centres should be clearly related to the place-making transformation plans for these centres articulated in spatial policies and site allocations, and subject to the further tests set out in this policy, and the wider design policies of SP1, SP3, SP5, SP7 and SP8.\n",
      "The remaining town centres may also be appropriate for tall buildings as identified by the Strategic Sites allocations, but these will be overall less significant in number and in height than those in Stratford and Canning Town.  2.49 In the remainder of the Arc, particularly south of Canning Town Town Centre there is capacity for tall buildings due to the large development sites which can absorb carefully planned innovative schemes, though the Airport’s safeguarding Area compulsorily restrains development heights over much of the area.\n",
      "However, tall buildings need to be deployed strategically, in relation to locations that are immediately accessible by high volume public transport links (DLR, Crossrail, tube) and to help mark the centres or other foci of new places, which will typically be around such stations.\n",

      "These assets also have a role to play in achieving the other objectives of the Local Plan of delivering growth and optimising development.\n",
      "Starting with heritage, until recently traditionally this has to some extent been overlooked in Newham both by statutory agencies such as Historic England, and others responsible for change in the borough, from home owners through to large-scale developers.\n",
      "This is partly due to Newham’s relatively recent development when compared to some areas which means heritage assets have been seen as less significant than older ones elsewhere, and partly the inevitable result of incremental changes (with limited character-based direction) which add up to more significant ones.\n",
      "As such, Newham currently has relatively few Conservation Areas and listed buildings despite having a range of identifiable heritage features including many fine examples of Victorian and Edwardian buildings, docks and waterways.\n",
      "It also means that through neglect, distinctiveness has been eroded and the physical condition of some assets has map of Heritage Assets deteriorated: this is reflected in the fact that the borough contains a variety of heritage assets on the ‘Heritage At Risk’ register1, for example 11% of listed buildings and monuments were considered to be ‘At Risk’ in 2017.\n",
      "These considerations emphasise the need for re-valuation of the Borough’s heritage assets. \n",

      "text:   2.68 Therefore in turn, the importance of attending to (protecting, conserving and enhancing, and thereby re-valuing) both designated heritage assets and those more informally recognised, together with their setting, is indicated.\n",
      "The former includes those buildings, monuments, structures, parks, etc., that are subject to national listing/ scheduling, those areas designated as Conservation Areas; the latter includes Areas of Townscape Value, (recognised for their special architectural and historic character) Archaeological Priority Areas (identified as per Historic England Advice for their potential archaeological interest) and Locally Listed buildings.   2.69 Their value includes adding interest and legibility, (as landmarks) to an area; the contribution to community building as a focus for community memory and activity; the contribution to sustainability by embodying energy if they continue in use; and harder economic value as visitor attractions either individually or as part of a place for spending time and money in, perhaps as part of a wider cultural economy strategy, or in the case of waterways, as transport routes.\n",
      "In turn they can be seen as important to create neighbourhoods which are desirable to invest and stay in, hence the need to address their presence and encourage wider ownership of and access to them.\n",
      "It should be noted that archaeological projects have a well-established history of enabling successful community engagement.   2.70 A more holistic approach to heritage in place-making is logically extended to other character assets, whether natural (including trees and woodland), cultural (e.g. meeting places and places of social display and other cultural activity including ‘back of house’ activities such as set and costume design which support other uses), architectural or infrastructural (e.g. stations) as part of the transformation plans for the borough (see Policies SP1 and SP3 and J1).\n",
      "These are indicated in relevant spatial policies and more extensively but not exhaustively in the Newham Character Study (2017).\n",
      "This approach recognises that all these asset types have in common sensitivity to change that directly or indirectly affects them and those that benefit from them, including the difficulty presented by competition with uses able to pay higher values for land.\n",
      "Moreover, many such assets are underperforming in one way or another, often due to a lack of integration with the wider environment including other assets, so that their settings detract from them, they are underused or create a barrier effect.\n",
      "This highlights the importance of composition - ensuring coherent and sensitive ensembles of assets and their settings, as well as innovation and change both from the present situation and to address evolving circumstances, including climate change.\n",
      "Innovation includes appropriate deployment of ‘meanwhile’ uses and other suitable measures to activate spaces and structures to help bring them back into people’s dayto-day experience of places, improving security, resilience to climate change and energy efficiency and enabling immediate community benefit.\n",
      "However, any such change needs to be based on an understanding of the sensitivity to change of the asset in question, ensuring it is appropriately valued and accommodated in order to avoid causing harm to its significance.\n",
      "It is also recognised, that in new places, or places needing to find new purposes and economic and social futures, creating new assets, for example through arts-and-culture-led regeneration will be beneficial. \n",

      "This policy therefore concerns existing and future Town and Local Centres as components of successful places in accordance with the overarching objectives of the Local Plan to create high quality places and successful communities and to optimise development.\n",
      "The need, particularly in the case of Town Centres, to be successful as economic places or destinations in their own right also promotes the other overarching Plan objective of delivering good growth, as measured by the degree of activation or vitality as well as commercial spending and competitiveness (viability) in line with national and Londonwide policy.\n",
      "Whilst there will be differing expectations in terms of the scale of town (and likewise, District, Major and Metropolitan) as compared to Local Centres, over-arching ingredients of place quality for centres are applicable whatever the scale and function.\n",
      "This is related to, but distinct from the technical and functional management of Town Centres and retail provision as part of a network and hierarchy, which is dealt with under the infrastructure section.   2.79 Evaluating the quality of place on offer in the Borough’s Town and Local Centres at present (using standard ‘health check’ methodologies , the results of consumer surveys and other engagement, as well as character analysis) identifies a number of weaknesses that need attention to make Town and Local Centres more attractive and pleasant.\n",
      "These have been combined with those aspects recognised as important by good practice guidance, whilst cross-referring to specific visions for centres where most change is needed and expected in the spatial policies.   2.80 Working from the outside in, or from people’s homes to their local and Town Centres, of key importance firstly is ensuring people can easily and enjoyably reach the centre from the local area, and that the point of arrival and public realm around the shops and services is convenient, attractive, easy to navigate around, accessible whatever a person’s ability, interesting in its own right, and safe.\n",
      "This includes ensuring that larger commercial uses do not create blank, inactive frontages, or over-large blocks which disrupt direct routes – indeed in many cases new development brings the opportunity to address past mistakes of this type.\n",
      "Research has found that well-conceived improvements to public spaces within Town Centres can increase expenditure in a centre by 40%, as well as generating further private investment1.\n",

      "These bring valued diversity that can add to local identity, whilst also allowing for changes to market circumstances over time.\n",
      "However, retail uses alone do not provide for sufficient activation and usage to create fully vital and viable Town Centres in today’s market, hence the importance of diversification both vertically above shops (mainly to residential) and across the centre.\n",
      "This should draw in new customers who may undertake linked trips, extend activity into the evening, and generally encourage people to spend longer in a centre as more of their needs are met in one place.\n",
      "In larger centres, provision for tourists and visitors from beyond the local area will also be important, including both visitor attractions (e.g. street markets) and facilities (e.g. toilets).\n",
      "The importance of quality leisure and cultural uses such as restaurants, bars, clubs, music venues and other performance space that contribute to the night-time economy is particularly recognised.\n",
      "The proximity of the Borough to Central London, and general appetite from local residents offers opportunities for development of a local night life in the Borough’s centres as part of the capital’s cultural offer.\n",
      "The London Plan SPG ‘Culture and the night-time economy’ notes that Stratford is one of 70 night-time clusters across the city yet the Borough has six town centres all of which could generate their own night-time identity appropriate to their role and function.   2.82 However, learning from past mistakes, clusters or overall numbers of non-retail uses should not be permitted to dominate a centre or its gateways, (in and outside its boundaries) detracting from its image.\n",

      "Recent development has often undermined the coherence of the borough’s Town Centres in particular, poorly relating to the scale, structure, focus, variety, detailing, heritage and other place-making assets of the existing Town Centres.\n",
      "For this reason, the design of a new development should clearly reflect (but not uniformly copy) these aspects of character and the need to integrate and reinforce the positive ones to contribute to a distinctive place identity on either a neighbourhood or (in the case of larger centres) a centre basis.\n",
      "Here, visions also play a role, as detailed in spatial policies, alongside the management of the hierarchy and network (in line with Policy INF5), to ensure all retail and town centre uses are located within centres of appropriate sizes, alongside as far as possible, community infrastructure that draws in significant numbers of people (e.g. worshippers and service users).\n",
      "This includes avoiding retail and other similar commercial development on smaller sites outside centres that can incrementally undermine the coherence of them by eroding their boundaries and creating unfocused ribbon development, as evident along many of the borough’s main roads and extending outwards from linear centres, notably East Ham, Green Street and Canning Town.\n",
      "A re-focusing of development within town centre boundaries, including relocation/residential conversion of existing out of centre commercial floorspace, together with improvements to gateways and more character-sensitive design, should help create a better sense of place. \n",

      "The corridors have an important role to play in the overarching objective of the Local Plan to create high quality places.\n",
      "The arterial corridors are also important movement routes, for pedestrian, cycle and motor traffic including buses supporting the achievement of Good Growth.\n",
      "They link economically important centres and generally provide the shortest route ways between main centres of activity helping to deliver growth, and they provide locations for optimal development in the borough.   2.89 The objective of seeking improvements in the quality of corridors sets out to reinforce both of these roles, particularly in relation to how they form people’s impression of routes towards central London and the local area.\n",
      "In doing so, the policy also seeks to reduce the linear ‘barrier’ effects felt by pedestrians and cyclists in particular, of major, often congested routes, and contribute to a lessening of congestion.\n",
      "Both barrier effects (connectivity) and congestion are noted to be key issues in the borough, congestion needing urgent attention due to the projected levels of new development in the borough and elsewhere.\n",
      "This has consequences for journey time and reliability, air quality, noise levels, the quality of the public realm, the health impacts of mode choice and people’s quality of life concerns, also noted by national and London-wide policy.   2.90 Many measures contribute towards the policy’s implementation in more than one of these dimensions.\n",
      "For example, making streets more pleasant places for people to use should encourage them out of their cars and into public spaces, which in turn helps to reduce traffic impacts and makes the area more liveable and more attractive generally.\n",
      "Animating streets and spaces by encouraging development with active frontages - windows and entrances, including appropriately-located community infrastructure, shops and street cafés - will also make streets safer and more interesting to use, particularly for pedestrians.\n",
      "Consolidating ribbon development into defined centres means that these destinations will be more clearly demarcated, reinforcing their viability, and tackling concerns about sprawling untidy frontages of mainly secondary retail, hot food takeaways and so on, which in stretching outside limited areas affect more people’s amenity.\n",
      "This means that where expansion of such uses or changes of use within those classes are proposed in these streets outside the areas and other designations (e.g. Protected Isolated Shops) identified in the relevant infrastructure (INF5) and Spatial Policies, (SP2, SP3) the policy position will be to encourage instead, relocation to in-centre locations, de-conversion to residential where Policies H1, H4 and INF8 can be satisfied, or if necessary, continuation of the status quo.   2.91 Policies SP1, SP3 and SP5 establish the importance of key place-making and urban design principles.\n",
      "It is vital that these are extended into the street and in edge treatments, as these can have a particular impact on people’s ease of navigation, entry and egress from buildings and spaces, sense of security and comfort.\n",
      "As well as activation and surveillance, key considerations include improving enclosure, and mitigation of environmental impacts of traffic.\n",
      "Improving enclosure by maintaining the building line has positive microclimate effects, as well as being visually pleasing (creating a more complete and coherent street composition), though care must be taken not to over-enclose by building heights and massing that are not in proportion to the street width.\n",
      "Mitigation of noise and air pollution impacts requires appropriate spacing, screening, and filtering (e.g. by trees) without compromising other design principles such as surveillance, and attention to character, heritage assets and sustainability.\n",
      "Other measures include ensuring properties are dual aspect, so can ventilate from the non-road facing side.   2.92 On the street, the experience of pedestrians and other passers-by will also be affected by the quality of the public realm itself.\n",
      "Here, simplicity yet attention to detail and quality are what is required, as noted by good practice guidance and stakeholder engagement, with de-cluttering having a major role to play, subject to inclusivity considerations.\n",
      "However, this should still allow for the incorporation of well-placed green infrastructure (particularly street trees) with its sustainability benefits, (drainage, air quality, shade and shelter) and public art. All these can improve the inclusivity of the environment, its functionality as a social space and movement space, and again the extent to which it is enjoyed. \n",

      "These impacts in turn can have wider health impacts as well as affecting people’s perception and enjoyment of place at all times.  2.107 The Policy also seeks to reinforce the protection and enhancement of green infrastructure, in line with broader strategic priorities set out elsewhere in the Local Plan, specifically recognising its relevance in relation to the achievement of neighbourly development due to its environmental and quality of life benefits.\n",
      "In doing so, this policy requires proposals to take into account any potential on or off site impacts (both direct and indirect) which could lead to quantitative or qualitative loss of green infrastructure, including private amenity space, trees, woodland, and public open space.\n",
      "This includes adequate consideration of negative impacts on biodiversity elements (e.g. via indirect ecological pathways such as impacts on drainage, habitat connectivity and shadowing).\n",
      "In relation to private amenity space, the policy protects garden land from development that results in its loss, in line with the NPPF and London Plan, seeking to recognise its role in providing for relief from urban intensity and as places of retreat.\n",
      "Proposals however should seek not simply to avoid such impacts, but to take opportunities to positively contribute to quality, quantity or accessibility of green infrastructure provision on or off site, including where appropriate, improvements to cross boundary accessibility (such as in the case of the Lee Valley Regional Park).  2.108 The environmental standards and design guidance in Table 4 set out to assist developers in the creation of successful, healthy and safe places through the use of recognised quality benchmarks and standards which in turn are used to help assess developments’ neighbourliness.\n",
      "Such standards play a key part in defining for example, how places can be designed to ensure all that need to, or would benefit from doing so, can access development with equitable ease.  2.109 All the aspects of the policy work together to impact on the nature of a place, neighbourhood or building, and the extent to which people can live happily, healthily and resiliently.   \n",

      "Other policies to which there is a logical link are highlighted encouraging responses that deal with the issues in an integrated way.\n",
      "Proposals should be accompanied by statements detailing their response to the components of neighbourly development set out in the Policy in design and management terms.\n",
      "Information should be sufficient to make adequate assessment against the required guidance and standards.\n",
      "Where necessary, neighbourliness measures will be secured by condition and/or legal agreement.   2.112 The policy intention is that applicants should pay attention to the environmental, social and design based impacts of their proposals on neighbourliness within the site and in the immediate area.\n",
      "In positive planning terms, the idea is to maximise the benefit of development through the ways in which it interacts with and plays its part in the wider context.\n",
      "It should encourage, for example, car club spaces open to all to reduce parking stress and secure more sustainable travel behaviours in a neighbourhood as a whole, a new development providing a missing walking network link through the site, or a new building for a particular community designed to respond to a more general lack of community space and to be welcoming to all.\n",
      "Early consideration of these matters will be encouraged through pre-application advice/design review and in implementing other consent approaches such as Permission in Principle, as well as through more proactive regeneration and local implementation plan work.   2.113 In promoting an Agent of Change approach to new development, it is important that consultation takes place with existing operators/occupiers to ensure that new development is deliverable and that the two uses are able to operate alongside each other; acknowledging not just the physical neighbours but also the river, air and highway traffic regulated by the Port of London Authority (PLA), Civic Aviation Authority (CAA) and Transport for London (TfL) who should also be consulted.\n",
      "It is recognised that the presence of London City Airport in close proximity to high profile regeneration sites creates particular sensitivities in terms of high levels of background noise at these new residential developments.\n",
      "Higher development costs are to be anticipated in these areas because of the necessity for effective design and building interventions that will enable residential development to proceed in areas that might otherwise have been considered unsuitable.\n",
      "Similarly, effective noise insulation of existing housing in the vicinity of the airport is desirable to protect living conditions.\n",
      "At the same time, the Agent of Change approach should not be construed as offering a licence to existing operators and occupiers for the unfettered intensification of disturbance- generating activity or other unreasonable behaviour: it is assumed that uses should be operating lawfully and reasonably.   2.114 To support applications, proposals should pay attention to the quality benchmarks and standards and associated guidance set out in Table 4.\n",
      "Expert advice will be taken within the Council or relevant partners to support these assessments and to ensure proposals are of the highest quality and address neighbourly development from the outset, and these benchmarks, standards and guidance documents are important to make that assessment.\n",
      "Where a development concerns an existing building (through conversion, extension, change of use) which does not meet such standards, this will be a consideration in itself as regards its suitability for the proposed change. \n",
