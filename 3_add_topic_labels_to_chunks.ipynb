      "text:   Walton lies in the valley of the River Wharfe.\n",
      "It is part of West Yorkshire and is situated two and a half miles from Wetherby.\n",
      "Its origins go back nine hundred years to Anglo- Saxon times and its full title is Walton-in-Ainsty.\n",
      "The name Walton is a common one, meaning ‘village or farmstead of the Britons’, and is taken from the Old English ‘Wahl’.   There is a strong Roman influence within the area, most notably with a Roman Road, Rudgate, running north/south alongside the eastern boundary of the village.   At the time of the Domesday Book (the village was surveyed in 1085 AD) it showed a population of 32 people with six manors containing land for nine ploughs and a given value of £1.50.   St Peter’s Church is imposing and historically significant.\n",
      "Although the Church dates back to a period of 1325 AD, it contains remains of an earlier Norman Church of around 1150 AD.\n",
      "The Wesleyan Chapel which also existed in Walton was pulled down in the 1960s.   By the time of the next Census in the early 1800s, the village had grown to 237 inhabitants and 1,670 acres of fertile land owned originally by the De Brus and De Arches families, followed by the Fairfax family around 1249 AD, and more recently by the Lane-Foxes.   The Enclosure Act of 1816 consolidated the lands benefiting both the Lane-Foxes and the Fisher family who both provided perpetual curacies locally.   In 1840, it was recorded that within the Walton boundary, there were two Inns (The Black Bull and The Fox and Hounds), one wheelwright, one tailor, one gardener, four shoemakers, three shopkeepers, three yeomen and eight farmers.\n",
      "This was the first recorded commercial framework to the village.   The Inns had originally been part of the dairy farmhouses, as was normal in those times.\n",
      "Only The Fox and Hounds survives to this day whilst The Black Bull reverted to Moor House Farm, a dwelling house.   The York and Midland Railway opened in 1847 with a station adjacent to Walton which connected the village with surrounding towns and cities, particularly Leeds and York.\n",
      "The railway was closed in 1964 following the Beeching Review.   During the Second World War, with the construction of the local armaments factories (now the TAE) the railway was extended to, and around, he factory buildings. \n",

      "Our prices seem much lower than re’new for both Barwick and the Scholes areas.\n",
      "Recent prices suggest that there is little difference between Barwick and Scholes prices unlike the re’new data.   2.47 We were interested to see how the profile of the property listed matched the profile of the dwelling stock.\n",
      "It should be noted that mismatches between the listings for sale and the fixed dwelling stock may not be directly comparable as there is no direct link between the composition of the stock and a vendor’s decision to sell.\n",
      "Nevertheless it is noteworthy that a smaller proportion of 3 bedroom homes and a larger proportion of 4 and 5 bedroom homes were on sale than all dwellings.\n",

      "For home ownership this is complicated by the fact that a deposit which is a percentage of the purchase price is required by lenders.\n",
      "First time buyers are facing anything up to a 20% deposit under present market conditions dependent on the lender standard terms and the borrower’s credit history.\n",
      "Existing home owners with a good credit rating would normally be able to fund their deposit from equity from the sale of their home.\n",
      "It is noteworthy that the Help to Buy scheme means that a 5% deposit applies and this is particularly popular with households seeking to buy new build housing.\n",
      "T   2.55 As an illustration, assuming a first time buyer in a single income household paid a 10% deposit on a home with a, £110,000 asking price, they would need a £99,000 mortgage.\n",
      "According to CLG guidance, a single income household would need an annual income of around £28,300 to service this loan, the loan being  3.5 times their annual income.     2.56 The A58-A64 North Quadrant Local Housing Market and Needs Assessment by consultants ‘re’new’, commissioned by Persimmon Homes in 2012 contains information about the average income levels across the city as at February 2011. We believe it is reasonable to quote this information as there has been recent wage restraint for many years.\n",
      "Average wages were quoted as being per annum:  • City centre £16,587;  • The golden triangle £34,959;  • The inner area £17,241;  • The outer area £27,907; and  • Leeds average £24,173     2.57 Using the illustration above and taking into account the parish house price information and these average income levels, it is clear that most households in Leeds are priced out of the parish housing market unless they have significant savings or equity in their current home.   2.58 Although there is relatively little rented housing in the parish it is helpful to understand the affordability of rented housing.\n",
      "Government practice guidance suggests that 25% of household income or less should be affordable to households.\n",
      "So a household income equivalent to the minimum wage would suggest that the household should pay no more than £250 per calendar month (pcm).\n",
      "Such households would seek to close the gap between this and market rents by claiming housing benefit.   2.59 Further, most letting agents use a different method for assessing whether a prospective tenant can afford the tenancy on offer.\n",
      "Their starting point is the rent not the tenant’s income.\n",
      "They multiply the rent by 30 to arrive at the minimum income that would be required without a guarantor.\n",
      "This means that a rent of say, £400 pcm requires an income of £12,000 pa which is close to the minimum wage.\n",
      "Tenants with lower incomes than 30 times rent will require a guarantor in addition to a tenancy deposit.\n",
      "However practice guidance would suggest that someone on this income should reasonably be able to afford a rent of £250.   The discrepancy between practice guidance and industry practice is noteworthy and means that the tenant will pay 1.6 times more rent than the government suggests they can reasonably afford.   2.60 This above explains why many younger people will struggle to achieve home ownership in the early stages of their working lives and rely upon the private rented sector to supply the housing they can afford.\n",
      "The absence of a large private rented sector in the parish coupled with a low proportion of smaller homes means that the parish does not have a housing offer that is either suitable for or affordable to the majority of younger households seeking housing.\n",
      "There is a good supply of rented housing in the wider Leeds housing market area. \n",
